10
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:28,910
PROFESSOR: We're going to talk
about inclusion-exclusion which

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,800
is a generalization
of what we did

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:37,250
at the end of last lecture,
which was about the sum rule.

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,550


14
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,890
Everybody's still
talking I hear.

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,290
Anyway, the inclusion-exclusion
principle is very important.

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:54,680
And the best way to explain
this is by using Venn diagrams.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,540
So let's do this.

18
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:57,890
So what did we do before?

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,620
When we worked on
a sum rule, we saw

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:06,940
that if we count the union of
a whole collection of sets that

21
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,170
are all disjoints, then we can
just some all the cardinalities

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,290
of each of the members.

23
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:17,110
So in the case where we have
intersections-- so sets are not

24
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:20,440
disjoint-- well, if you just
count all the cardinalities--

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,500
all of the sizes of
the sets together--

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,190
you'll start to do
some double counting.

27
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:27,600
So with the
inclusion-exclusion principle,

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,130
we can actually exactly
compute the cardinality

29
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,300
of the union of sets.

30
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,910


31
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,020
And you will see that
this principle can

32
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,010
be used in plenty of examples,
including some of them that

33
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,050
are on the problem set.

34
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:49,740


35
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,740
So how does it work?

36
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,950
So let's set take an example
where we just have two sets

37
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,050
and they have an intersection.

38
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:01,550
So say this is one set which
we call M, and say here

39
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:07,450
is another set which
we call E. Well, they

40
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,530
have an intersection-- there's
some overlap over here.

41
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,650
So if you would
like to write out

42
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,720
the different areas
over here, what

43
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,870
they were equal to, well, this
is everything that is in M,

44
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:29,610
but we exclude what is in E.
So you write it M backslash E.

45
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,940
This part over here
is the intersection

46
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,910
of-- this maybe is a little
bit too small-- so this is

47
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,335
the intersection of both sets.

48
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:42,320


49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,710
And over here we have
everything that's

50
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:49,330
in E but excluding what is in
M. So if you just write out

51
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,960
the cardinalities of
the different sets

52
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,543
that we're interested
in-- so we would

53
00:02:52,543 --> 00:02:56,680
like to compute the cardinality
of the union of M and E.

54
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,490
So let's have a look
how the cardinality of M

55
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,590
itself can be computed.

56
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:08,890
Well, if you use the sum rule
which says that we can simply

57
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:14,120
add the two disjoint
sets that make up set M--

58
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,560
we can count each of
those cardinality--

59
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,510
so we have M consisting of this
part, which is M excluding E,

60
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,550
plus the part that is right
here which is the intersection.

61
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,900
So we use the sum
rule and conclude

62
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:36,670
that we have the sum
of everything that's

63
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,980
in M excluding E
plus the cardinality

64
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,020
of the intersection.

65
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,560
Now, for set E we can do
something completely similar.

66
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,920
So we will have
everything that's

67
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,190
in E excluding what
is in M. And then

68
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,540
we still have the intersection.

69
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,810
Now we are interested in the
union of the sent M and E.

70
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,440
And now we need to add
this one this one and this

71
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,220
once together.

72
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,280
So what do we see?

73
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,970
We see that this is
actually equal to everything

74
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,630
that is in M but not
in E, everything that

75
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,294
is in their intersection,
plus everything

76
00:04:17,294 --> 00:04:20,810
that's in E but not in M.

77
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,110
So we have these equations
that we can directly derived

78
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,150
from the sum rule.

79
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:31,900
And, well, now we can
see here that if we

80
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,330
are going to simply add-- that's
what the sum rule would say--

81
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:40,340
simply add the
cardinality of M and of E,

82
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,520
well, if we add
those two together,

83
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,240
we will count the
intersection double.

84
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,680
So we'll need to cancel that
because it's only counted once

85
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,780
in the union.

86
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,400
So if we combine those three
over here-- those three

87
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:06,850
equations-- then we can conclude
that this counts the set

88
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:10,320
M intersecting with E twice.

89
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,770
So we have that
the union is really

90
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,980
equal to the cardinality
of M plus that

91
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,280
of E minus their intersection.

92
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,650
Now we can generalize this.

93
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,460
And we will give
one more example

94
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:34,240
where we have three sets and it
will give the general equation.

95
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,780
So suppose you have
three sets now.

96
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,840
Like one, another one,
and another one over here.

97
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,790
So we have M, E, and,
say, the set S. Well,

98
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,880
let's have a look how many
times these different areas--

99
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,380
they're all disjoint--
how many times they

100
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:04,100
are counted when me add the
three cardinalities together.

101
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,760
So we have M plus
the cardinality of E

102
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,600
plus the cardinality
of S. Well, if you

103
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,430
do that then we count
this area exactly

104
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,020
once because it's in M, this
area we count once because it's

105
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,360
in M and another time because
it's in E-- so it's twice--

106
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,820
this particular area
is only counted once

107
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,080
in this sum over here.

108
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,160
And similarly, we have two
times over here, two times here,

109
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,980
and one times over here.

110
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:36,840
And this intersection
of all of the three,

111
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,580
well, it's counted when
we count elements in M

112
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,445
but also when we
count elements in E

113
00:06:41,445 --> 00:06:43,870
and also when we
count elements in S.

114
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,700
So this is counted three times.

115
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,260
So let's have a look.

116
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,460
It seems like we want to
do exactly the same as what

117
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,390
we did before.

118
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:01,532
We like to subtract an
intersection of M and S.

119
00:07:01,532 --> 00:07:02,240
That's this part.

120
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,440
It cancels the double
counting in this area, right?

121
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,490
We can subtract this
intersection such that this

122
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,520
part is cancelled.

123
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,340
The double counting
here is canceled.

124
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:14,290
And similarly, we
want to subtract

125
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:17,750
the intersection between
E and S which would

126
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,300
eliminate this double counting.

127
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,090
But now we can see that
we start to subtract

128
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:29,030
too much because this central
area here will be-- well,

129
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,000
it's part of each of
those intersections

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,130
so it's actually eliminated.

131
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,310
All of it is subtracted.

132
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,490
So let's create
the same diagram.

133
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:47,370
But now when we count the sum
of all those intersections--

134
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:52,840
so we have the
intersection of M intersect

135
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,450
with E, the intersection
of M with S,

136
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,480
and we also want to figure
out how many times elements

137
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:09,570
are counted in the set
E intersects with S.

138
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,490
So let's have a look.

139
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,830
Well, this area here
is counted zero times.

140
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:17,330
It's not part of any
of these intersections

141
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,950
because it-- this part is
only in M and not in S or E.

142
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,020
So this is counted zero times.

143
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,530
And here we have the same.

144
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,530
Well, this part over
here is exactly once

145
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,980
in this intersection
between those two sets.

146
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,710
It's not in this one so
this is counted once.

147
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,030
So we have by symmetry
that for all the others.

148
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,809
This area, however, is in both
this intersection as well as

149
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,200
this one and also this one.

150
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,270
So it's counted three times.

151
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,540
So now we can easily start to
combine all these together.

152
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:58,490
And you can see, if we take
this sum and we subtract this,

153
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,020
then the middle
area is cancelled.

154
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,180
So we have to still add the
intersection of the three sets.

155
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,030
The intersection of
M, E and S together.

156
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,060
So in a formula that
would look like this.

157
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,040
So we are interested
in the union.

158
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,930


159
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,540
And this can now be
written as, well,

160
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,000
the sum of the cardinalities
of the individual sets.

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,830
And we subtract
the intersections

162
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,160
that we have up there.

163
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,743
So M intersect E
minus M intersect

164
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:44,780
with S and minus E
intersect with S.

165
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,256
Now we have eliminated-- if
you look at this Venn diagram

166
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,755
over here-- this
diagram over here--

167
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,950
we've eliminated everything
that's in the middle area.

168
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,130
So we still need to add
intersection-- everything that

169
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:02,220
is counted in the intersection
of M, E, as well as S.

170
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,940
So we have this equation.

171
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,390
And now you can see why we call
this the inclusion-exclusion

172
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,700
principle.

173
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:15,510
Here we include all the
elements in M, E and S.

174
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,800
Now we have to exclude
what we counted too much.

175
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,310
So we have exclusion over here.

176
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:24,830
And now we, again, have
to include some stuff

177
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:29,080
because we excluded too much.

178
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,430
And then we keep
on going like this.

179
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:39,420
So, in general, we get
the following theorem

180
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,640
that says that, if you
look at the cardinalities--

181
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:48,770
of the cardinality of the union
of a whole bunch of sets--

182
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:54,490
say we have n sets-- then this
is actually equal to-- well,

183
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,900
we first include the sums of all
the individual cardinalities.

184
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:08,960
Which is from I equals 1 to n
cardinality of Ai minus-- now

185
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,270
we have to, again,
we have to eliminate

186
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:16,820
all the double counting-- so
we look at every pair of sets

187
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,580
indexed by i1 and i2.

188
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,690
And we look at
their intersection

189
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:26,320
and we take that out
using this minus sign.

190
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,430
We exclude this.

191
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,240


192
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,350
And we continue like this.

193
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:35,250
So we add now-- because
we have excluded too much,

194
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,850
we have to include
some more-- we

195
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:45,860
look at all triples of sets
indexed by i1, i2-- oops--

196
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,650
and i3.

197
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,820


198
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:54,110
And now we look at the
intersection of those sets.

199
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:58,400


200
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,030
And we continue like
this all the way

201
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:09,170
until we look at the very last
intersection that you can have,

202
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,830
which is intersection
of all the sets.

203
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,790
And it depends on whether
n is even or add whether we

204
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,040
have to include or exclude it.

205
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,520
So we have a minus 1
to the power n plus 1.

206
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,950
And then we have the
intersection of all of these.

207
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,900
Now, we can write this out
in a more elegant formula

208
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:40,690
where we just put all this
what I wrote here in a sum.

209
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,010
And then it looks like this.

210
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:47,310
It's the sum over k
equals 1 to n minus 1

211
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,460
to the power k plus 1.

212
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,540
So depends whether
k is even or odd

213
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,570
whether we do an inclusion
or an exclusion in this sum.

214
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:03,870
And we look at all the subsets
that our subsets of the index

215
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:11,220
set 1 up to n such that the
cardinality of the set S

216
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,440
is equal to k.

217
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,430
And now we need to look at
the cardinality of all--

218
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,880
of the intersection of all the
sets that are indexed by S.

219
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:31,265
So that's-- so I run-- I put i--
so do the intersection of all i

220
00:13:31,265 --> 00:13:34,630
in S of the sets Ai.

221
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:39,430
So this general formula is the
inclusion-exclusion principle.

222
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,930
And this is the way
how we can think

223
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,980
about it how to derive it.

224
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,140
Of course, this is not a proof.

225
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,250
But you could do this
yourself by using induction.

226
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,700
And you can use induction on n.

227
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,250
So that's a pretty
straightforward exercise.

228
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:55,750
OK.

229
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,385
So let's give an example.

230
00:13:57,385 --> 00:14:00,180


231
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,630
Let's do that over here.

232
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,480
You will have a problem that's
similar on the problem set.

233
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,290


234
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:11,540
And it's goes like this.

235
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:16,190


236
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,540
You would like to know how
many permutations are there

237
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,740
with a special property.

238
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:31,930
So how many permutations
do I have of the set 0,

239
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,420
1 all the way up to 9.

240
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,120
So all the digits.

241
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:47,140
And that have consecutive--
so I put this in brackets just

242
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,945
to clarify-- so consecutive
either a 4 and a 2 right next

243
00:14:51,945 --> 00:14:52,570
to one another.

244
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,940
So remember, a permutation
is a sequence that has each

245
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,900
of those digits exactly once.

246
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,420
And I like to count
those permutations that

247
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,980
have a 4 and a 2 next to
one another in this way.

248
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,270
So we have 4, 2.

249
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:16,800
Or the permutation may
have a 0, 4 or a 6, 0.

250
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,725
So I'm very curious, how
many permutations do I have?

251
00:15:19,725 --> 00:15:21,810
And I'm going to use this
principle that I just

252
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,310
described.

253
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,730


254
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:29,970
So how do we need to
go ahead with this?

255
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:33,960
Well, this-- so I'm interested
in the permutations that have

256
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,110
a 4 and 2 next to one another.

257
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:38,770
So that could be my
first set, say, M.

258
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,611
And then I have
a set that I want

259
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:42,860
to count that has the 0 and
the 4 next to one another.

260
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,920
That could be my
E. And the S could

261
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,210
be those permutations that
have the 6 and a 0 next to one

262
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:48,830
another.

263
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:51,480
So then I would like to
use that rule over here.

264
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,130
So I would also need to count
all the intersections and so

265
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:55,630
on.

266
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,010
So let's do this.

267
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:59,960


268
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,780
Let me first give an example
of such a permutation.

269
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:07,250
So for example, I could
have the permutation

270
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:13,570
that is the sequence 7,
2, 5, 6, 0, and the 4,

271
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:19,420
for example, 3, 5, 1 and 9.

272
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,720
So I have all the digits
that are in the-- contained

273
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,680
in the set.

274
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,940
And I see that, actually,
this particular permutation

275
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,760
has a 6 and a 0
next to one another.

276
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,900
So it's in this particular--
the set of permutations

277
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,460
that have a 6 and a 0.

278
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,710
I can also see it
has a 0 and a 4.

279
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,000
So it's also in the set of
permutations that have a 0

280
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,560
and a 4 next to one another.

281
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,060
OK.

282
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:46,260
So now I'm going to define
these different sets

283
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,530
and then we're going to
start counting these.

284
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:53,450
And this is the type
of counting that you're

285
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,740
doing in this problem set.

286
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:59,210
And the intuition
that you create

287
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:02,390
by doing that you
can use later on when

288
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,740
we study probability theory.

289
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,390


290
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:07,890
OK.

291
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,460


292
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:19,760
So let's define the set P4,
2 as all the permutations

293
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:27,980
that have-- so it's the set
of permutations with 4, 2.

294
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:33,380
And similarly, we have P0, 4
which is the same thing but now

295
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,320
with 0, 4.

296
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,680
P6, 0, the set of full
permutations with 6, 0.

297
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:44,030
So let's have a look at what
the sizes of an individual

298
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,900
set of permutations.

299
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,310
How can we do this?

300
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:58,270
So let's have a look at the
size of, say, this one, P60.

301
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:02,410
Well, what kind of trick can
I do in order to count this?

302
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:07,520
So we have learned a
few rules last time.

303
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,565
And what I would like
to do is, well, this

304
00:18:09,565 --> 00:18:12,460
is a slightly more
complex structure,

305
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:15,330
so I would like to
map this to a set

306
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,710
by means of a bijection
That will be great.

307
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:22,480
Then to do some
kind of other sets

308
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,520
that is easy to count for me.

309
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,480
So then, by the
bijection rule, I

310
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,100
will be able to figure out what
the cardinalities of this set.

311
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,060
So the trick here is to
find such a bijection.

312
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,380
And the idea is that you could
actually treat the 6 and the 0

313
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,540
as one unique symbol.

314
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,350
So let's see how it works.

315
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,710
So what I could do is I
can have, from the set

316
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:49,860
of-- from P60-- so all
the permutations that

317
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,450
have 6 and a 0 next
to one another-- I

318
00:18:52,450 --> 00:19:03,390
can find a bijection to the
permutations of the set that

319
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:07,371
have 6, 0 as a single symbol.

320
00:19:07,371 --> 00:19:09,870
And then I have all the other
symbols, all the other digits.

321
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:19,400
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 0.

322
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,776
So let's have an example of--
we have one up here, actually.

323
00:19:24,776 --> 00:19:29,890


324
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,240
So how would I map this?

325
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,250
This would be mapped
according to that definition.

326
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,370
To 7, 2, 5.

327
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,380
And now I combine 6 and 0 into
one symbol in my sequence.

328
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,580
And then I have the rest.

329
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:50,890
4, 3, 5, 1, and 9.

330
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:55,840


331
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,760
Now this is easy for
me to count, right?

332
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,690
So this is a bijection.

333
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,180
And by the bijection rule,
the cardinality of this set

334
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:09,270
is equal to the total number
of permutations on this set.

335
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,690
Now, this set has
exactly eight elements

336
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,820
so I know how many there are.

337
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:18,740
So I know that the cardinality
is equal to 8 factorial.

338
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:23,370
Because there are 8 factorial
permutations on sets of size 8.

339
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,560
We saw that last time.

340
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,430
So that's the trick or--

341
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,070
AUDIENCE: Nine.

342
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,153
PROFESSOR: Oh, is it nine?

343
00:20:30,153 --> 00:20:33,210
Oh, yeah, you're right.

344
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,440
Great.

345
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,220
So this is 9.

346
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,460


347
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:42,940
And similarly, in the same way,
we can also count these, right?

348
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,700
We can treat 0, 4 as one
symbol or 4, 2 as one symbol.

349
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,390
So I also know that the
cardinalities of these

350
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:55,435
are also equal to 9 factorial.

351
00:20:55,435 --> 00:20:57,560
Now, when I use the
inclusion-exclusion principle--

352
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,190
so now I've computed
those three,

353
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:02,240
essentially-- I need to
subtract their intersections.

354
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,340
So let's compute
the intersections.

355
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:10,500


356
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:17,090
And if you do that, we're going
to use the exact same trick.

357
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,580
So we're going to find the
bijection to permutations

358
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,640
of a set of symbols.

359
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,280
And we just have
to specify those.

360
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,470
So let's do this together
and take, for example,

361
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:41,130
the intersection
of P42 with P60.

362
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:44,450
So what kind of a
bijection could I have?

363
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:50,770
So it will be all-- to
all the permutations

364
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,860
on what kind of a set?

365
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,680
So I use the exact
same trick here.

366
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,400
So I'm going to treat 4 and 2
as one symbol and 6, 0 as one

367
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,700
symbol.

368
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,630
So I have 4, 2, 6, 0 and
then all the other digits.

369
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:14,410
So it's the 1, 3,
5, 7, 8, and 9.

370
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:17,650
You can count that
this number is 8.

371
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:20,990
So by the bijection
rule, we have

372
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,880
that the cardinality
of this intersection

373
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,810
is equal to 8 factorial.

374
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,830
And we continue
like this to compute

375
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,480
all the other intersections.

376
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,780
And they do look a little
bit different sometimes.

377
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:40,580
So for example, if I
have 6, 0 and P 0, 4--

378
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:48,110
so let me define the permutation
first-- or the bijection first.

379
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,899
So how do we do this one?

380
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:51,565
Any suggestions?

381
00:22:51,565 --> 00:22:54,870


382
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:58,860
So what kind of a set can
I find a permutation to?

383
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:04,130
If I look-- so over here I have
a permutation in which 6 and 0

384
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,520
are next to one another.

385
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,550
But this is also a
permutation in which 0 and 4

386
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,790
are next to one another.

387
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,699
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

388
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:13,740
PROFESSOR: Yeah, exactly.

389
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,900
So 3, 6, 0 and 4 is one
symbol because permutation

390
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,740
is right in here has a 6
and 0 next to one another.

391
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,950
And the 0 should also be next to
the 4 because it's in this set

392
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,180
as well.

393
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,930
So we know that every
permutation in here

394
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:34,250
has a sub sequence of 6,
0, 4 next to one another.

395
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,680
So we can treat
this as one symbol.

396
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,180
And then we have
all the other ones.

397
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:43,010


398
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:47,520
And again, this is--
these are 8 elements.

399
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,330
So we have that also,
for this intersection,

400
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,340
the cardinality is equal,
by the bijection rule,

401
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,460
as the total number
of permutations

402
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,375
on a set of eight elements,
which is 8 factorial.

403
00:23:59,375 --> 00:24:08,900


404
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:15,930
So for the last one, we
also have similar-- so

405
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,680
let me see which
one I need to do.

406
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:23,460
So I have 4, 2 and 0, 4.

407
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,900
Well, again, I do
the same trick.

408
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,820
Now I have a symbol that has--
well, the permutation here

409
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,280
has a 0 and a 4
next to one another,

410
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,530
and the 4 is next to a 2.

411
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,780
So I treat this as one symbol.

412
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:45,260
So if the permutations on
the set 0, 4, 2, and then

413
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:52,450
1, 3, 5, 7-- oh, and 6
as well-- 8 and nine.

414
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:59,235
So the cardinality of this set
is also equal to 8 factorial.

415
00:24:59,235 --> 00:25:02,140


416
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,410
So now we still have to look
at the intersection of all

417
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,480
of those three in order to
use the inclusion-exclusion

418
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,140
principle.

419
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,640
And, well, the same trick
can be used over here.

420
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,980
So we look at the
intersection of P60 with P04

421
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:26,400
and the permutations that have
4 and 2 next to one another.

422
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,467
So what does that mean?

423
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:30,300
It means that the
permutation that's in here

424
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,260
has a 6, 0 and then
a 4 and then a 2.

425
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:37,190
So these are all the
permutations with a 6, 0, 4,

426
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,160
2 next to one another.

427
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:46,630
And this can map
easily to the sets

428
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,040
where we treat this
as one symbol-- 6042--

429
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,470
and then we have 1,
3, 5, 7, 8, and 9.

430
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:01,720
This set has seven elements, so
the intersection of these three

431
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,630
is equal to 7 factorial.

432
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,540
And now we can use the
inclusion-exclusion principle

433
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:12,450
using this over here.

434
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,600
And when we plug
everything in here,

435
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,750
we can see that the
intersection-- that the union--

436
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:27,850
when we count the union of P60
which P04 and P42 is actually

437
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:32,480
equal to 9 factorial for
these, 8 factorials for those,

438
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,930
and a 7 factorial for these.

439
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:39,990
So it's 3 times 9 factorial
minus 3 times 8 factorial

440
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:43,962
plus 1 times a 7 factorial.

441
00:26:43,962 --> 00:26:46,295
So this is how we can use
inclusion-exclusion principle.

442
00:26:46,295 --> 00:26:51,900


443
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,140
So this generalized
the sum rule.

444
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,220
And now we have a
whole set of rules

445
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,819
already discussed
since last time.

446
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,360
We continue with
the bookkeeper rule.

447
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,340
You have already seen
it during recitation

448
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:07,990
so I will only write
it out once more.

449
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:11,570
And all these rules
together we will then

450
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,670
use in a set of examples.

451
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:19,070


452
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:21,060
So what was the bookkeeper rule?

453
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:34,600
We have that-- so the
bookkeeper rule is,

454
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:41,050
if I have distinct copies of
letters-- so distinct copies

455
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:56,170
of letters l1, l2,
l3 and lk, well, then

456
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:01,830
the number of
sequences that have

457
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,010
exactly n1 letters
of the type l1

458
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,610
and n2 letters of the type
l2 and so on, well, we

459
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,120
can count those.

460
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:24,080
So sequences with n1 copies
of l1 and n2 copies of l2,

461
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:32,200
and then we continue like this
until we have nk copies of lk.

462
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,800
Well, we can count this.

463
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,840
So these copies can
be in an arbitrary

464
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,480
order in the sequence.

465
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:43,140
And we saw in recitation that
this can be written as n plus 1

466
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:50,350
plus n2 all the way
up to nk factorial.

467
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:55,440
And we divide out the product
that starts with n1 factorial

468
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,040
times n2 factorial
up to nk factorial.

469
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,470
And this we also can
write as what-- well,

470
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,440
this is actually the
definition of what we call

471
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,900
the multinomial coefficient.

472
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,740
So you've already seen the
binomial coefficients, which

473
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,530
is a special case of this one.

474
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:23,030
So we write this as
n1 plus up to nk.

475
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,190
And then we have
n1, n2, and we just

476
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,770
repeat all of those in here.

477
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:38,800
If we have k equals 2, then we
get the binomial coefficient.

478
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:43,310
And if k equals this 2,
we also often just forget

479
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,060
about the last term.

480
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,930
So we would get
expressions that look

481
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:54,390
like this, which is really
equal to nk comma n minus k.

482
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:54,890
OK.

483
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:59,220
So this is some-- these
are some definitions.

484
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:02,660
And we can apply
this bookkeeper rule.

485
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,480


486
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,800
For example, last time in the
lecture we were talking about

487
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:15,000
the number of bit sequences
of length 16 with four 1's.

488
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,740
We wanted to count this because
we found out that if you want

489
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:25,660
to select 12 donuts
of five varieties,

490
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,270
we can find a mapping of
bijection towards this set

491
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:33,380
of bit sequences with
12 0's and four 1's.

492
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:39,870
So the bookkeeper rule will tell
us exactly how many there are.

493
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,650
And that's the most basic
example, essentially,

494
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:49,300
of this way of counting.

495
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,500
So what do we have?

496
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,250


497
00:30:53,250 --> 00:31:04,890
So the number of bit sequences
of length 16 and with four

498
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:09,160
1's-- well, is exactly equal
to, according to this rule,

499
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:15,440
as length 16 and we need to
choose four 1's out of these

500
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:15,990
16.

501
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:18,180
And it's the
binomial coefficients

502
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:26,250
where we choose four
out of the 16 symbols.

503
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:30,180
And this is equal to 16
factorial divided by 4

504
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,110
factorial times 12 factorial.

505
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,570


506
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:43,730
Now we often also denote
the following rule--

507
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:47,310
we sort of identify
as a special case.

508
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:53,740
We say that the number of
k elements-- of k element

509
00:31:53,740 --> 00:32:06,420
subsets-- of an n element set
is actually equal to n choose k.

510
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,840


511
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,120
So this is an important
rule to remember

512
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,615
which will occur many times.

513
00:32:13,615 --> 00:32:22,370


514
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,780
OK.

515
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,590
A theorem that we can have
derived from all this stuff

516
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:29,510
is what we call the
binomial theorem.

517
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:31,020
So we'll quickly go over that.

518
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:37,090


519
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:41,580
The binomial theorem says
that, for all integers n--

520
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,840
positive integers n-- we have
a plus b to the power n equals

521
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,320
to the sum where we
take k from 0 to n

522
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,250
and then we have the
binomial where we

523
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,900
have this expression over here.

524
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:06,840
We choose k out of n
and we choose, say, k

525
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,982
times b in this expression.

526
00:33:08,982 --> 00:33:10,690
I will explain in a
moment by an example.

527
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,630
And n minus k ace.

528
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,170
And this is the theorem.

529
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,300
And I will just
give an example just

530
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,300
to show how we can
think about this.

531
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,510
So let me do that over here.

532
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,050


533
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:31,595
So if you take n
equals to 2, then we

534
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:34,830
can see that we get all the
combinations, essentially,

535
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,380
of a and b of length 2.

536
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:42,420
So you have a times a, a times
b, b times a, and b times b.

537
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,300
So what do we see?

538
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:51,470
We see a squared plus ab
plus ba plus b squared.

539
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:56,980
Now we see that these have 1
times an a and 1 times a b.

540
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,660
This one has 2 times an a
and this one has 2 times a b.

541
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,420


542
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:08,449
And this combines together
as a squared plus 2 times

543
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:11,340
ab plus b squared.

544
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:16,179
Now, if you have n equals 3--
so we have a plus b to the power

545
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:22,100
3-- you will get all
the different products,

546
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,889
all the different terms,
that add up to this,

547
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:29,940
are all the kinds of
combinations of a's and b's.

548
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:36,880
So for example, we have three
a's-- so 3 times a-- but it can

549
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:47,739
also have a squared times b
plus aba plus b a squared.

550
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:53,840
And those have exactly two
times an a and one times a b.

551
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,650
I can now look at
all the others--

552
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,600
so I may have two times
the b and one times the a.

553
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,570
So what our those?

554
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:11,570
We have a times b squared
plus bab plus b squared a.

555
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:16,550
So I count these
as the same, right?

556
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:19,340
They each have the
same number of b's.

557
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,510
Two times the b and
one times the a.

558
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:27,110
And then, finally, I
have b to the power 3

559
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,120
which counts three times the b.

560
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,120
So these are all the
possible terms that I have.

561
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,510
There are eight in total.

562
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,436
One, two, three, four,
five, up to eight.

563
00:35:35,436 --> 00:35:36,310
And that fits, right?

564
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:39,877
Because I can have a
choice of an a and a b.

565
00:35:39,877 --> 00:35:40,960
And I do that three times.

566
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,440
So 2 times 2 times
2 is equal to 8.

567
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,090
So I have eight terms.

568
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:50,170
And I can group them together
by taking a to the power 3

569
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:57,080
plus 3 times a squared
b plus 3 times-- and now

570
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:04,830
I have b squared a-- and
finally, b to the power 3.

571
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,980
So what do we see here?

572
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:09,860
How many terms are their
that have exactly two times

573
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,630
an a and one times a b?

574
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:17,370
Well, it's like we have a
set of three elements, right?

575
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,470
Or three positions.

576
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,250
And I like two of
them to be an a.

577
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,580
So I choose two out of
those three to be an a.

578
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:30,870
So I use this subset rule
to count how many times I

579
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:35,270
see the same term back.

580
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:42,650
So let's write this
out so that is-- so

581
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:50,960
the number of terms
that have k times an a,

582
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,120
and we have, say, n
minus k times a b.

583
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,680
So how many terms do I have?

584
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:09,700
Well, that is the length
of-- so the number of-- oops.

585
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,280
Change that.

586
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:16,320
So it's the number
of length n sequences

587
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,350
that have the
following property.

588
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:27,220
That these have k a's
and n minus k b's.

589
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,390
And that's easy to count.

590
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:32,120
Which is equal to what
we have done here before.

591
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:36,700
We have the binomial n choose k.

592
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:39,130
And that, if you plug
that in over here,

593
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,400
then we get this particular sum.

594
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,980
So it is-- this is
the binomial theorem.

595
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,910
Very famous.

596
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,960
And now we're going
to use all this stuff

597
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,660
to count some poker hands.

598
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,440
So we have come to this
part of the lecture.

599
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,740
So we're going to do
a bunch of examples

600
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,830
that are similar
to some of those

601
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,460
that you will see
in the problem set.

602
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,145
And then at the end
we go and continue

603
00:38:03,145 --> 00:38:07,190
with some-- with a
different proof technique.

604
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:16,260
So let's first define
a deck of cards

605
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,870
because that's what we
are going to use now.

606
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:26,430
So for this type of
problems, we will

607
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:34,810
use a deck which is
actually a set of 52 cards.

608
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:44,490
And a card itself
actually has a suit.

609
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:47,140
And the suit can
be something that

610
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,170
looks like this, which
is called spades.

611
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,970
S of spades.

612
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:58,500
We have another symbol
which is this, hearts.

613
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:06,670
And we will have clubs
and we have diamonds.

614
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,970
And besides a suit, a
card also has a value.

615
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:21,030
And the values are arranged from
2, 3, 4, all the way up to 10.

616
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:24,440
Then we have a special
symbol-- special value--

617
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,600
which is called the Jack.

618
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,030
We've got a Queen and a
King and finally the Ace.

619
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:35,930
And in total, we have
13 possible values.

620
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,930
So you can see that
we have four times,

621
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,900
because of four different
suits, 4 times 13

622
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,330
is 52 different cards
and that makes up a deck.

623
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,450
So we're going to look at hands.

624
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:55,605
And a hand is actually
a collection-- a set

625
00:39:55,605 --> 00:39:57,720
of five cards.

626
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:04,560
So it's a subset of
the deck of five cards.

627
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,310
And we do not worry
about the order

628
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,290
of the cards in your hand.

629
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,210
They can be permuted,
if you want.

630
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,480
So the order's not important.

631
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,750
So it's a subset of five cards.

632
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,460
So how many hands do I have?

633
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,130


634
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,550
Well, how many ways
are there to choose

635
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:31,740
a subset of five cards
out of a deck of 52 cards?

636
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,900
Well, we can use
a subset through

637
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,670
and we get the
binomial 52 choose 5.

638
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:41,150


639
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:44,900
Which is, by the way, a lot so
let me write it out as well.

640
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,710
It's about 2 and 1/2 million.

641
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:53,430


642
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:57,280
So we are interested
in, when we play poker--

643
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,450
if you do that-- in
really good hands.

644
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,920
So we like four of
a kind, which means

645
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,420
that we have four cards that
actually have the same value.

646
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:14,160
Or we have cards
that-- hands that have

647
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,270
what we call a full house.

648
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,120
We will count those in a moment.

649
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:20,240
Or other kinds of combinations.

650
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,170
And the rarer the combination
is in your hand, the higher

651
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,820
or the better your hand
is, and the more likely

652
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:33,080
it is that you win
the poker game.

653
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,550
If you do not get left out.

654
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,050
All right.

655
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:41,000


656
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,030
So let's give an example
of a four of a kind.

657
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,840
So we're going to
compute those and we

658
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,350
will see that we need to do--
to use all the-- a combination

659
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,183
for all these rules.

660
00:41:53,183 --> 00:42:02,260


661
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,600
OK.

662
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:11,180
So four of a kind
is the special hand

663
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:19,245
where we have four
of one kind of value.

664
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:23,210


665
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:26,200
Notice, by the way, that the
fifth card, because of this,

666
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,440
must have a different
value, right?

667
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,780
Because there are
only four cards

668
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,090
that have, say, the value eight.

669
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:37,030
Because there are only
four different suits.

670
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,540
So the fifth card
will ultimately

671
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,650
have a different value.

672
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:49,310
So as an example, we will have
the 8 of spades and then the 9

673
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:52,930
of diamonds and all the
other 8's-- the 8 of diamonds

674
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:55,930
and the 8 of hearts and,
say, the 8 of clubs.

675
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,440


676
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,820
And how do we count
these types of hands?

677
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,620
We're going to look
for a representation

678
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:08,070
of how can you represent
such hands, such objects?

679
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:11,120
So we have to count a
special type of object,

680
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,310
a special kind of poker hand.

681
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:15,800
And in order to do
that, we're going

682
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,190
to look for a way to
represent these objects

683
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:24,450
and in such a way that we
can count them very easily.

684
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,530
And that's really
the trick in order

685
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,500
to solve these kinds
of counting problems.

686
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:32,680
So the representation
that we have here is--

687
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:36,420
well, we can choose--
first of all,

688
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:46,430
we can choose the value of the
four kinds-- of the four cards.

689
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,970
So how many choices do I have?

690
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,820
Well, I got any choice.

691
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:57,990
There are 13 different
values so I have 13 choices.

692
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:01,260
So that's easy.

693
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:06,510
Secondly, I can choose the
value of the extra card.

694
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:10,920


695
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,310
So how many choices
do I have here?

696
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:18,450
Well, the four of a kind already
eliminates one kind of value

697
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:19,100
completely.

698
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:19,600
Right?

699
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:25,020
So I have any of the
other values is possible.

700
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:27,370
Is equally likely, even.

701
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:30,670
So I have 12 choices.

702
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:35,870
And, lastly, I can represent--
I need to still represent

703
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,280
the suit of the extra card.

704
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:43,279
So I also want to know the
suit of the extra card.

705
00:44:43,279 --> 00:44:44,570
And how many choices do I have?

706
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:47,080
Well, I can choose
any of those four.

707
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,970
So that's four.

708
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:52,110
So, essentially, what
we constructed here

709
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:57,830
is a mapping by using
this representation.

710
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:03,510
And the mapping tells
us-- is as follows.

711
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,040


712
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,292
Let's keep this up.

713
00:45:07,292 --> 00:45:15,330


714
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:21,390
So the mapping goes from poker
hands-- from card-- from hands

715
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:27,940
to-- from hands with four of
a kind to this representation.

716
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:29,480
So let's write it out.

717
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,960
So we have four of a kind.

718
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,080
And then we have a
function-- a mapping

719
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,240
f-- that goes to
this representation.

720
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:43,020
We will have the first
entry-- the value 1

721
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,795
and the value 2
and then a value 3.

722
00:45:45,795 --> 00:45:48,930


723
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:54,780
So for example, if you
take this hands of cards,

724
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:01,820
well, the first one, we see that
the four of a kind has value 8.

725
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:06,860
The value of the second card is
the 9 of the 9 diamonds cards.

726
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,520
So we have 9.

727
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:11,580
And finally, the suit
that I need to select for,

728
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,910
the extra card is diamonds.

729
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,031
So this is an example.

730
00:46:15,031 --> 00:46:18,120


731
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,940
And now we know, because
this is a bijection,

732
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:25,030
we know that the number of
hands with four of a kind

733
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:29,340
is equal to all these
types of sequences,

734
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:33,780
all these types of
sequences that can--

735
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:37,860
that are chosen according
to this representation.

736
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,970
Well, we have 13 choices
for the first value.

737
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:46,060
And given this first
value, we have 12 choices

738
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,750
for the second value.

739
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:53,840
And given those two, I have four
choices for the very last entry

740
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,870
in this sequence.

741
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:59,100
So this is the generalized
product rule that I'm using.

742
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:05,950
So we see that the number of
sequences is equal to 13 times

743
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,170
12 times 4.

744
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:10,650
Turns out this is equal to 624.

745
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:15,250
Well, if you divide it
over total number of cards.

746
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,476
So how did we do this?

747
00:47:16,476 --> 00:47:18,017
This is the generalized
product rule.

748
00:47:18,017 --> 00:47:21,500


749
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,560
If you divide this number
of the total number of cards

750
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:28,030
we could get the fraction
of one over about 4,000.

751
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:30,045
So it's really rare that
you get four of a kind.

752
00:47:30,045 --> 00:47:33,321
So it's a really good hand.

753
00:47:33,321 --> 00:47:33,820
OK.

754
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:36,280
Let's do a few more of these.

755
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:44,180


756
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:47,520
We also like to know how
many full houses there are.

757
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,270
A full house is a special hand.

758
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:54,740
It has three cards of one value
and two cards of another value.

759
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:10,280


760
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,290
So how many are there?

761
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,115
So again, we are going to
use the exact same principle.

762
00:48:15,115 --> 00:48:17,850
We're going to find
a representation

763
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,020
of this type of hand.

764
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:30,340
So we have three cards of one
value and two cards of another.

765
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:36,690


766
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:42,990
So for example, we may have
the hands that contain,

767
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:46,060
say, three cards with value 2.

768
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:50,970
A 2 clubs, a 2 spades,
and also a 2 diamonds.

769
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:55,520
And, say, a Jack club
and a Jack of diamonds.

770
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:01,330
And another example could be,
say, a 5 of diamonds and a 5

771
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:10,000
of hearts, 5 of clubs, 7 of
hearts, and also a 7 of club.

772
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,390
So now you can see that it's
very easy to represent this.

773
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:12,890
Right?

774
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:15,700


775
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,020
We can start grouping
things together.

776
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,330
We can say, represent
this by first

777
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:27,810
taking the value of the
three cards that I have here.

778
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:29,630
So it's 2.

779
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:33,330
Then I want to indicate in a
second term in my sequence--

780
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:37,910
in my representation-- which
suits did I use over here?

781
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:40,490
Well, I used clubs,
spades and diamonds.

782
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:46,560
So it's a set club,
spades and diamonds.

783
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,180
And now I also have a pair.

784
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,550
Like, two cards
with the same value.

785
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:52,960
What's the value?

786
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:53,990
It's Jack.

787
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:57,630
And what are the suits
associated to these?

788
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,870
Well, clubs and the diamonds.

789
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:04,964
So I have not yet for-- given
you the formal definition

790
00:50:04,964 --> 00:50:06,380
of the representation,
but you can

791
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,440
see that you could do
something like this.

792
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:11,100
So this is often how we start
out on a piece of paper.

793
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:17,390
You try to do something
and hopefully it works.

794
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:21,200
So we have-- here we have
diamonds, hearts, and clubs.

795
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,850


796
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:28,160
And then we have--
finally we have two cards

797
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,150
with the same value 7.

798
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:34,090
And they have the hearts
and clubs as suits.

799
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:37,540


800
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,170
OK.

801
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:48,310
So the representation
is defined as follows.

802
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:59,830
It just started out with a first
entry in my representation.

803
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:03,250
And this is going to be
the value of the triple.

804
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:06,670


805
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,980
So how many choices do
we have for this value?

806
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,330
Well, I can choose any of
the 13 possible values.

807
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,890
So I have 13 choices.

808
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:23,220
And the second part is
the suits of the triple.

809
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:28,450
Well, I have to choose
a subset of the four

810
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:30,300
possible suits of size three.

811
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,870
So I need to have a subset
of size three out of the four

812
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:35,690
possible suits.

813
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,830
And that will give me the
proper representation.

814
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:42,320
So how many choices do I
have for such a subset?

815
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,190
Well, there's three
elements out of four.

816
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:50,840
So we can use the subset
rule and see that this has

817
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:55,675
4 choose 3 equals four choices.

818
00:51:55,675 --> 00:51:58,370


819
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:02,560
Then the last part is
to value of the pair

820
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,230
that I have of the two cards
that are having the same value.

821
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:09,240


822
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,920
Now, how many choices
do I have here?

823
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,160
Well, I have to be a
little bit careful, though.

824
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,360
I just want to make sure that
I do the right reasoning here.

825
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,890
I know that there's still--
because I chose a triple

826
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:26,310
of cards of the same
value-- for example,

827
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:31,600
over here I chose all these
2's-- but I still have one card

828
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,120
in my deck which has a 2.

829
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:36,400
Actually, here I've chosen
clubs, spades and diamonds.

830
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,910
So the one that is missing
is the 2 of hearts.

831
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:42,910
So I could possibly
choose the 2 of hearts.

832
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:43,710
But wait a minute.

833
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:47,306
If I choose the 2 of hearts,
how can I make a pair?

834
00:52:47,306 --> 00:52:48,430
That's not possible, right?

835
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:51,970
Because I've already
chosen all the other 2's

836
00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:55,440
so there's no other 2
to match to find a pair.

837
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:01,360
So I actually cannot choose this
particular value of this triple

838
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,640
for the pair.

839
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,970
But all the other
values are possible.

840
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:09,450
So I have 12 choices.

841
00:53:09,450 --> 00:53:12,960
One less than the one that I've
already chosen for the triple.

842
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,930


843
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:21,370
Now, and then similarly, I
can choose suits of the pair.

844
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:23,810
And how many choices do I have?

845
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:27,230
Well, look at every
possible subset

846
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:31,230
that I can have of size
two out of the four suits.

847
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:35,160
So I use the subset rule
and find that this is 4

848
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:40,780
choose 2 which is equal to 6.

849
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:44,180
So now we're going to multiply
all of these together.

850
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,030
We use the generalized
product rule again.

851
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:52,640
So we have found a mapping
from hands with a full house

852
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,070
to these types of
representations--

853
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:57,040
to this representation.

854
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,450
And this mapping is bijective.

855
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:03,210
So the number of full house
is exactly equal to the number

856
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:06,940
of these representations.

857
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,530
And by the generalized
product rule,

858
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:12,210
I can choose the first entry
of such a sequence in 13 ways.

859
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:15,960
The second one, given the
first one, in four ways.

860
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,400
This one I can choose
in 12 ways given I've

861
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,760
already chosen my triple.

862
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,730
And so on.

863
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,580
So by the generalized
product rule,

864
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:26,290
I know now that the
product of those four

865
00:54:26,290 --> 00:54:30,740
is equal to the total
number of full house hands.

866
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,940
So how much is that?

867
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:39,710
It's 13 times 4 choose 3
times 12 times 4 choose 2.

868
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:44,910
And this turns out
to be equal to 3,744.

869
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:49,410
Which is a factor six bigger
than a four of a kind.

870
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:52,060
So it's much more likely
that you get one of those.

871
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,790
And that's the reason
why four of a kind

872
00:54:53,790 --> 00:55:01,410
has more worth-- is worth
much more than a full house.

873
00:55:01,410 --> 00:55:06,670
So let's do another example,
a hand with two pairs,

874
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,190
and see whether we can continue
this type of reasoning.

875
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:11,010
It's going pretty well.

876
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:15,626
And maybe we can
do the same thing.

877
00:55:15,626 --> 00:55:20,940


878
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,190
We'll see that, in
counting, you really

879
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,260
have to take a lot of care.

880
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,630
So maybe you can
already see what's

881
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:32,300
happening when I start reasoning
in the exact same way as

882
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,130
before.

883
00:55:34,130 --> 00:55:36,950
So let me first define
what I want to count.

884
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:43,750
It's a hand that have
exactly two pairs.

885
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:44,850
So what does that mean?

886
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:53,680
It means that there is-- that
we have two cards of one value

887
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,870
and another two cards
of another value.

888
00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:07,900


889
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:12,190
So let's start out as before.

890
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:14,820
We're going to write
out a representation

891
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,660
and see whether we
can do this properly.

892
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:25,470
So we're going to use
the exact same technique.

893
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:28,150
So first of all,
we're going to choose

894
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,380
the value of the first pair.

895
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:37,080


896
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,580
Now, how many ways
can I do this?

897
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:42,770
Well, I can do this in 13 ways.

898
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:44,350
Any possible value is possible.

899
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:48,320


900
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:52,810
I need to choose the
suits of the first pair.

901
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:56,280


902
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,740
And how many ways can I do this?

903
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,670
Well, I use the same
techniques as over here,

904
00:56:59,670 --> 00:57:04,500
so it's any possible way
to choose two elements out

905
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:09,260
of a set of four which
represent all the suits.

906
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,300
So that's 4 choose 2.

907
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:19,140


908
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,350
Then, three, we're
going to choose

909
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:24,520
the value of the second pair.

910
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,340


911
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:31,600
Well, that's easy because the
second pair, by definition,

912
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:36,050
must have a different value
than the one in the first pair.

913
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:38,330
Well, I've already
chosen one value

914
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:41,780
so I have 12 choices left.

915
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,518
So that's no problem.

916
00:57:43,518 --> 00:57:49,870


917
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:53,430
And now we can continue
and do the same thing.

918
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,850
So we're going to count the
number of suites that are

919
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:58,420
possible for the second pair.

920
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:01,310


921
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:06,870
And it's the same number as
we have for the first pair.

922
00:58:06,870 --> 00:58:10,820
So we have a number of
suits of the second pair.

923
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,490
Again, we need to
choose two suits out

924
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:18,470
of the complete set of suits,
which has four possibilities.

925
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:20,790
So it's 4 choose 2.

926
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:25,870
And now we can have still a
choice for the last cards.

927
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,510
We have now two pairs.

928
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:29,220
We still have a fifth card.

929
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,230
The fifth card also has a value.

930
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,800


931
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,560
Actually, I did
not write it down,

932
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,660
but if we talk about
a hand with two pairs,

933
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:42,640
we mean two cards of one value,
two cards of another value,

934
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:47,000
and the fifth card-- the extra
card-- has yet another value.

935
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,370
Because otherwise you
would have a full house

936
00:58:49,370 --> 00:58:52,610
and we have already
counted those.

937
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:53,110
OK.

938
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:58,140
So value of the extra card.

939
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:00,230
Well, I've chosen
already two values.

940
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:03,110
The one for the first pair,
the one of the second pair,

941
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:05,830
so there are 11 choices left.

942
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:10,390
And finally, I can choose
a suit of the extra card.

943
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:16,320
Well, I have one out of
four choices for my suit.

944
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:19,900
So again we can use the
generalized product rule

945
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:26,690
and we can say that we have
30 choices for my first entry

946
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:28,500
in my presentation.

947
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,000
Right?

948
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,980
For the first choice.

949
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,970
Then given the first
choice, I have 4 choose

950
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:37,190
2 choices for the second.

951
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:39,936
And then 12 choices
for the third

952
00:59:39,936 --> 00:59:41,580
if I've already
chosen the first two.

953
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,750
And so on.

954
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:47,090
So I can use the
generalized product rule

955
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:50,520
and count these representations.

956
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:54,980
So the number of
representations is actually

957
00:59:54,980 --> 01:00:01,720
equal to 13 times 4
choose 2 times 12 times

958
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:07,241
4 choose 2 again times
11 times 4 choose 1.

959
01:00:07,241 --> 01:00:10,130


960
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:15,230
So is this a number of
the hands with two pairs?

961
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:16,930
So this seems to be
pretty reasonable.

962
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:23,780
But can you see something that
has happened here that we also

963
01:00:23,780 --> 01:00:25,290
saw actually last lecture?

964
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:27,810


965
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:32,520
Like, do I know for sure
that the hands with two pairs

966
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:38,820
is-- well, that are this
number of hands with two pairs.

967
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:43,100
What do I need to check in order
to make sure that that is true?

968
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:47,800
Well, I need to make-- I
need to prove, essentially,

969
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:49,690
that this representation
is actually

970
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:52,340
bijection from the
hands with two pairs

971
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:55,470
to this types of sequences.

972
01:00:55,470 --> 01:00:57,740
So is that true?

973
01:00:57,740 --> 01:01:00,495
Or does this mapping have
a different property?

974
01:01:00,495 --> 01:01:03,100


975
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:06,988
Any ideas?

976
01:01:06,988 --> 01:01:07,488
Yeah?

977
01:01:07,488 --> 01:01:09,396
Over there.

978
01:01:09,396 --> 01:01:10,247
AUDIENCE: No.

979
01:01:10,247 --> 01:01:10,830
PROFESSOR: No?

980
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,505
You don't want to answer?

981
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:13,990
OK.

982
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:22,270
Well, let me-- when we talked
about the chess game last time,

983
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:25,620
or with the rooks,
we could essentially

984
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:28,800
had two rooks that we
could choose and put them

985
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:33,950
on different positions with no
shared rows or shared columns.

986
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:39,780
And here we have two pairs with
no shared suit-- with no shared

987
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,080
values.

988
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,640
But what can we do?

989
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,850
We can actually interchange
the first and the second pair.

990
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:54,340
So as an example, we can
have two representations

991
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:55,730
that map to the same hand.

992
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:56,880
So let me give an example.

993
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,300
So for example, suppose
you choose the value

994
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:02,810
3 for the first
pair and then I'm

995
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:08,730
choosing the set diamonds and
clubs for the suits of those.

996
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:15,020
And say the second pair is a
queen of diamonds and hearts.

997
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,370
And finally, I have
an ace of clubs.

998
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:22,090
Well, this would be a
proper sequence according

999
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:24,070
to this representation.

1000
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:26,210
But this maps to a
hand that does also

1001
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:30,540
map to if we interchange the
first and the second pair.

1002
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:36,020
We can also start off with
the queen for the first pair

1003
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:38,500
and we have diamonds and hearts.

1004
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:44,515
And we have three for the second
pair with diamonds and clubs.

1005
01:02:44,515 --> 01:02:47,440


1006
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:50,110
And then we finally have
the fifth card which

1007
01:02:50,110 --> 01:02:52,820
is the same, the ace of clubs.

1008
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:57,730
Now these map to
exactly the same hand.

1009
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:00,495
We just need to change the
first and the second pair.

1010
01:03:00,495 --> 01:03:10,020
Now this is a kind of problem
or a mental sort of confusion

1011
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,760
that very easily happened.

1012
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,920
This is a rather easy
example where you can see it.

1013
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:17,860
But if you do
counting, we really

1014
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:22,660
have to take care that
we make sure that each

1015
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:26,920
of the sequences in
this representation

1016
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:32,450
are really represented by,
say, one hand, in this case,

1017
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:34,000
with two pairs.

1018
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,430
But how can we remedy this?

1019
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:42,570
It turns that we can-- by
interchanging these two pairs,

1020
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:46,000
these two sequences are
the only two sequences

1021
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,990
that map to the same hand.

1022
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,200
So we know that this
is not a bijection

1023
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:54,090
but it is a 2-to-1 mapping.

1024
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:59,590
So now we can choose-- we
can use the division rule.

1025
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:06,220
And by the division
rule we now know

1026
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:14,530
that the number of
hands with two pairs

1027
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:20,070
is actually equal to this whole
thing over here divided by 2

1028
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:23,448
because we have a
2-to-1 function.

1029
01:04:23,448 --> 01:04:25,810
Now, this is really
something that

1030
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:27,310
is pretty disturbing
because we have

1031
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:29,340
a near miss in our reasoning.

1032
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:32,770


1033
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:34,510
And therefore, it
is important to keep

1034
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:38,250
in mind the following
guidelines when we do counting.

1035
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:44,170


1036
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:47,230
It's very important
to, first of all, check

1037
01:04:47,230 --> 01:04:49,060
whether it's truly a bijection.

1038
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:55,970
And you need to know how many
sequences or maps to the same--

1039
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:57,350
to the same hand.

1040
01:04:57,350 --> 01:05:01,612
So the guidelines
are as follows.

1041
01:05:01,612 --> 01:05:05,330
They're pretty
straightforward actually.

1042
01:05:05,330 --> 01:05:09,420
First of all, if
we have a function

1043
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:14,470
f that maps from A to
B, then we would really

1044
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:19,250
like to check very carefully
whether the number-- what

1045
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:24,580
is the number of
elements of A that are

1046
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:38,380
mapped to each element of B?

1047
01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:43,080
So we check how many to one
of a mapping this really is.

1048
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:47,760
And after this we will then
apply the division rule.

1049
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,710


1050
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:53,870
It's very important
to check this.

1051
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:56,980
But very often, we're
making mistakes.

1052
01:05:56,980 --> 01:05:58,920
For example, right now
I'm doing some research

1053
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,030
and I've been
counting something.

1054
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:06,689
Turns out it-- if I
use a different method

1055
01:06:06,689 --> 01:06:08,730
to count the same thing
I get a different answer.

1056
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:10,820
So I made a mistake somewhere.

1057
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,590
So that's the second guideline.

1058
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:17,360
So what you want to
do is you want to try

1059
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,704
and solving a problem
in multiple ways.

1060
01:06:19,704 --> 01:06:23,420


1061
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:27,680
So try solving a problem
in a different way.

1062
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,010
And especially with counting
this is very helpful.

1063
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:33,290


1064
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:36,420
So this will lead
to an extra check.

1065
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,545
So we will do that for
this particular example.

1066
01:06:38,545 --> 01:06:42,340


1067
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,270
And it generally
would always like

1068
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:49,780
to find multiple ways to
prove things, I would say,

1069
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:55,160
because at least you want
to have multiple-- maybe not

1070
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,630
a complete proof but
subparts of proofs--

1071
01:06:57,630 --> 01:07:00,480
you may want to find different
ways why that is true.

1072
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,380
So that's how I usually
do my proofing of things.

1073
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:11,370
So let's find a second way
to count this over here,

1074
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:13,720
to do the double check.

1075
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:18,220
So we're going to create a
different representation that

1076
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:22,750
should actually
lead to a bijection.

1077
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:24,675
So I want to find a
representation that's

1078
01:07:24,675 --> 01:07:29,020
a bijection, a 1-to-1 mapping.

1079
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,730
So how do we do this?

1080
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:41,090
I can-- let me see where I am.

1081
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:41,590
OK.

1082
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:48,470
So what I could do
is, first of all,

1083
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:54,260
I can choose the values
of the two pairs.

1084
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:59,220
So in this case, I have
the values 3 and the queen.

1085
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:01,700
So how many choices do I have?

1086
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:04,000
Well, I can choose
two out of 13 choices.

1087
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,790


1088
01:08:06,790 --> 01:08:11,340
Secondly, I'm going to describe
the suit of the smaller

1089
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:15,920
pair which is uniquely defined
because they have two values.

1090
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,430
One is smaller and the
suit of the smaller

1091
01:08:18,430 --> 01:08:27,500
pair I can choose by taking one
out the four-- two out of four

1092
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:32,950
choices because I need to choose
two suits for the smaller pair.

1093
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:34,840
For the larger
pair, I do the same.

1094
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:38,020


1095
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:41,680
And I get 4 choose 2.

1096
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:45,936
Now, again, I have the
value of the extra card.

1097
01:08:45,936 --> 01:08:49,359


1098
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:51,399
And I have 11 choices.

1099
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:56,090
I have already chosen two so
there are 11 choices left.

1100
01:08:56,090 --> 01:09:00,600
And finally, the suit
for the extra card

1101
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,660
can be done in 4 choose 1 ways.

1102
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:06,290
So if you multiply
those together,

1103
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:10,990
we get 13 times 12 divided by 2.

1104
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:18,310
And then we get times 4 choose 2
times 4 choose 2 times 11 times

1105
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:19,779
4 choose 1.

1106
01:09:19,779 --> 01:09:22,359
And we can see that
that's exactly the same

1107
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:25,390
as this whole
product divided by 2.

1108
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:27,490
We actually have a bijection.

1109
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:30,870
This particular representation
is a 1-to-1 mapping.

1110
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:33,290
So it's always good
to find a second way

1111
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:49,910
to prove the same result.

1112
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:50,410
OK.

1113
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:54,104


1114
01:09:54,104 --> 01:09:54,895
Let me do one more.

1115
01:09:54,895 --> 01:09:59,660


1116
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:00,660
Let's do that over here.

1117
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:05,480


1118
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:08,870
Just to make sure that you
really understand this stuff,

1119
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:15,030
I'm going to count hands
that have each suit in it.

1120
01:10:15,030 --> 01:10:21,450
So I want to count the
hands with every suit.

1121
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:24,710


1122
01:10:24,710 --> 01:10:38,020
So as an example, I can
have, say, the 7 of diamonds,

1123
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:44,080
the King of clubs, the 3 of
diamonds, the Ace of hearts,

1124
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,090
and the 2 of spades.

1125
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:47,710
Why is this a proper hand?

1126
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:51,470
Because I can see the diamonds,
the clubs, the hearts,

1127
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:52,200
and the spades.

1128
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:56,725
So I have a hand in which
every suit is represented.

1129
01:10:56,725 --> 01:10:59,370


1130
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:02,520
So what do I do for
my representation?

1131
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:15,150
Well, I can have the
values of each suit

1132
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:17,870
and I assign a specific
order to those.

1133
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:23,090
So I want to represent for
the diamonds and the clubs

1134
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:25,830
and the heart and the spade.

1135
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:29,440
I want to find out what
values do I really have.

1136
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:41,320
So values of each suit in the
order D, C, hearts and spades.

1137
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:43,610
And how many ways do I have?

1138
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:47,876
Well, I have 13
values for the 7,

1139
01:11:47,876 --> 01:11:51,330
I have 13 values for
the King-- for this one,

1140
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:54,210
for this value, 13 values
for that one and 13

1141
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,690
values for this one.

1142
01:11:56,690 --> 01:12:00,430
So that is pretty
straightforward.

1143
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:02,130
Now, we still have
the extra card.

1144
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:10,340
And the extra card
has a suit which

1145
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:14,950
I can do in four ways
because of four choices.

1146
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:18,540
And finally, it
also has a value.

1147
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,500


1148
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:27,520
And the value is-- it's
actually-- so how much is this?

1149
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:29,430
Can this be 13?

1150
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:31,920
Are there 13 values?

1151
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:32,910
No, not really, right?

1152
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:37,580
Because for each possible
given suit that I've chosen,

1153
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:43,880
I already chose a
value before when

1154
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:48,610
I chose a value for the
suit that I did over here.

1155
01:12:48,610 --> 01:12:52,030
So for example, this
one cannot be the 7,

1156
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:53,330
it has to be something else.

1157
01:12:53,330 --> 01:12:55,100
There are 12 choices.

1158
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,550
If I would have chose
a different suit,

1159
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:59,400
for example hearts,
then I would not

1160
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:01,800
be able to choose the Ace
because I already have chosen

1161
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,050
the Ace in the first step.

1162
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:07,890
So I have 12 possibilities here.

1163
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:11,260
So this is not 13.

1164
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:13,630
You may want to
check that again.

1165
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:19,690
So now let's give the
representation for this one.

1166
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:23,180
So I can have diamonds, clubs--
so let's see, in the order

1167
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,260
of diamonds, clubs.

1168
01:13:24,260 --> 01:13:28,640
So I have the 7,
I have a King, I

1169
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:34,000
have for hearts I have an
Ace, for spades I have a 2.

1170
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,450
Then I have the suit for the
extra card which is a diamonds.

1171
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:42,990
And then a value which is a 3.

1172
01:13:42,990 --> 01:13:44,960
Now we are going
to check according

1173
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:49,080
to our guidelines over here.

1174
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,370
We're going to check
the number of elements

1175
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:55,160
that are-- the number
of sequences that

1176
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:59,940
map to the same hand over here.

1177
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:02,830
So is this a bijection?

1178
01:14:02,830 --> 01:14:03,690
It's not, right?

1179
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:07,100


1180
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:09,200
So why is this not a bijection?

1181
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:14,450
Well, we can also have
the following situation

1182
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:18,340
where we swap the 3 diamonds
and the 7 diamonds around.

1183
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:21,800
So we choose the
3 for the diamonds

1184
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:25,440
and then we have the
King, the Ace and the 2.

1185
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,070
then we have the fifth card
which is also diamonds,

1186
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:31,530
but now it's the 7.

1187
01:14:31,530 --> 01:14:37,720
Well, this one also maps
to this particular hand.

1188
01:14:37,720 --> 01:14:41,370
So we have a 2-to-1 mapping.

1189
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:45,420
And we conclude that the
total number of hands,

1190
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:50,630
where every suit is represented,
is 13 to the power 4 times

1191
01:14:50,630 --> 01:14:54,600
4 times 12 by the
generalized product rule.

1192
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:58,970
And now by the division rule,
we have to still divide by 2.

1193
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:00,376
So that's the total number.

1194
01:15:00,376 --> 01:15:03,120


1195
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:03,620
OK.

1196
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:07,950
So now we come to
combinatorial proofs.

1197
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:12,095
So this is a new
proof technique.

1198
01:15:12,095 --> 01:15:17,382


1199
01:15:17,382 --> 01:15:18,840
And what we're
going to do is we're

1200
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:22,610
going to count a set
in two different ways.

1201
01:15:22,610 --> 01:15:27,440
And that will lead to a
combinatorial equation.

1202
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:32,890
So the whole idea is as follows.

1203
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:34,680
So let me give an example first.

1204
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:39,640


1205
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:44,270
So for a combinatorial
proof, for example,

1206
01:15:44,270 --> 01:15:51,460
suppose I have n
shirts and I want

1207
01:15:51,460 --> 01:16:01,760
to choose-- I want to keep k
and I want to trash n minus k.

1208
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:07,050
So how do I count the number
of choices that I have?

1209
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:10,916
Well, I can choose, out of n,
I can choose the k keepers.

1210
01:16:10,916 --> 01:16:13,490


1211
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:15,460
But I also can count
it in a different way.

1212
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:19,680
I can also count
this as how many ways

1213
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,390
I can select the trashers.

1214
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:28,910
So there are n minus k out of
n shirts that I will trash.

1215
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:35,220
So there are two different
ways to count the same choices

1216
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:36,670
that I have.

1217
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:42,130
So we have an
equation over here.

1218
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:45,040
And you already know this
one because by the definition

1219
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,540
of the binomial
coefficient, we have

1220
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:51,080
that this is equal to this.

1221
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:53,000
And so it's pretty
straightforward.

1222
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,070
It's equal to this
one over here.

1223
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:58,990
But the idea is that
we're going to count

1224
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:00,510
a set in two different ways.

1225
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:08,820
So another example is where
we have the following.

1226
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:18,660
We choose a team of k elements.

1227
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:26,790


1228
01:17:26,790 --> 01:17:31,180
Of k elements out
of-- oh, actually, I'm

1229
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:32,280
talking about a team.

1230
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,640
I was talking about
students here.

1231
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,655
Of k students.

1232
01:17:35,655 --> 01:17:38,620


1233
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:40,750
Out of n students.

1234
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:44,260
Now, how many ways
can I do this?

1235
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:47,450
Well, n choose k, right?

1236
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:49,440
Well, there is a way to
count this differently.

1237
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:56,360
I could also say, well, let's
first count the total number

1238
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:02,980
of ways in which I choose k
students that includes Bob.

1239
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:05,260
So let's do that.

1240
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:13,050
So Bob is one of the
students, and if I

1241
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:18,860
count the number
of teams with Bob,

1242
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,270
how many choices do I have?

1243
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:24,480


1244
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,590
I choose Bob.

1245
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:29,650
I still need to choose k minus
1 students out of the remaining

1246
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:30,770
n minus 1 students.

1247
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:32,330
So I have taken out Bob.

1248
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:34,700
So there are n minus
1 students left

1249
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:36,935
and I still need to
choose k minus 1 students.

1250
01:18:36,935 --> 01:18:39,920


1251
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:45,820
The other possibility is that
we have teams that-- in which

1252
01:18:45,820 --> 01:18:48,880
Bob is not represented.

1253
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:54,310
So now we need to
choose k students out

1254
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:56,980
off all the students minus Bob.

1255
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:01,190
So we have n minus 1 choose k.

1256
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:05,350
So by the sum rule, we can
just add those two together

1257
01:19:05,350 --> 01:19:09,050
and that should be equal
to all the possibilities

1258
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:12,070
to choose team of k students.

1259
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:12,990
So what do I see?

1260
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:18,070
I see that n minus 1 choose k
minus 1 plus n minus 1 choose

1261
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:23,270
k should be equal to--
well, before I counted it

1262
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:29,330
as this-- so it should
be equal to n choose k.

1263
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:32,495
And this is called
Pascal's Identity.

1264
01:19:32,495 --> 01:19:35,820


1265
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:39,110
And the general idea is is
that we do the following.

1266
01:19:39,110 --> 01:19:46,710
So we are actually counting
a set in two different ways.

1267
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:49,990
That's what we did so far.

1268
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:52,980
And when you solve
these types of problems,

1269
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:58,740
the difficulty is that you
will need to define the set S.

1270
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:00,240
So usually you
get a problem, you

1271
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:03,830
need to prove some
equation like this.

1272
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:07,790
So you define a set S.
That's the hard part of it.

1273
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:12,590
Then we are going to show
that the cardinality of S

1274
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:17,550
is some number n,
say, in one way.

1275
01:20:17,550 --> 01:20:19,770
So we have one
method to do this.

1276
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:20,680
By counting.

1277
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,870


1278
01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:33,210
And we will show that S is also
equal to some other number--

1279
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:35,260
like, in this case,
we had one number

1280
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:38,600
and this was my second
one-- also by counting.

1281
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:43,270
And then we can
conclude that n--

1282
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:47,532
so we conclude that n equals m.

1283
01:20:47,532 --> 01:20:50,400


1284
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,440
So we're almost done
because I'm going

1285
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:58,980
to prove to you a very simple
equation using this technique.

1286
01:20:58,980 --> 01:21:03,312
But it is not as trivial as
the one that we saw just now.

1287
01:21:03,312 --> 01:21:06,790


1288
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:08,570
What we do now is the following.

1289
01:21:08,570 --> 01:21:11,380
We want to prove a
theorem that says

1290
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:17,320
that if a sum r is 0 all
the way up to n, then,

1291
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:20,520
if you take the product of the
following binomial coefficients

1292
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:26,370
n choose r times 2n
choose n minus r,

1293
01:21:26,370 --> 01:21:30,460
this is equal to 3n choose n.

1294
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:32,670
We need to prove this.

1295
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:34,950
So we need to find
the proper set.

1296
01:21:34,950 --> 01:21:36,249
So how can we think about it?

1297
01:21:36,249 --> 01:21:37,790
Well, the idea is
that we're probably

1298
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:43,020
going to choose n elements
out of 3n elements.

1299
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:45,620
We're going to do
it in a special way.

1300
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:50,890
And so the proof
will be as follows.

1301
01:21:50,890 --> 01:22:05,050
We take S to be all the
subsets of n balls chosen

1302
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:19,990
from a basket of n red
balls and 2n green balls.

1303
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:22,540
And this will do the trick.

1304
01:22:22,540 --> 01:22:25,310
So how do we do this?

1305
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:32,690
We're going to first choose
the red balls and then

1306
01:22:32,690 --> 01:22:35,110
the green balls.

1307
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:40,360
So let's first count S
in the very easy way.

1308
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:44,570
Well, I just choose n balls
out of a basket of 3n balls.

1309
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:47,100
I don't care how many
green or red balls I have.

1310
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:51,465
So I have really 3n
choose n choices.

1311
01:22:51,465 --> 01:22:53,990


1312
01:22:53,990 --> 01:23:09,660
This is the number of n element
subsets from a 3n element set.

1313
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:10,507
So that's easy.

1314
01:23:10,507 --> 01:23:14,710


1315
01:23:14,710 --> 01:23:16,860
Now, we can also count
it in a different way.

1316
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:22,480
We first of all wonder
about the number of subsets

1317
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:26,430
with exactly r red balls.

1318
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:28,710
So how many are there?

1319
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:32,220
Well, we choose r red balls
so we have n red balls.

1320
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:35,760
So we need to choose
r out of those.

1321
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,690
Now, in total, I need
to choose n balls.

1322
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:41,700
So I still need to choose
n minus r balls out

1323
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,830
of the set of green balls.

1324
01:23:43,830 --> 01:23:46,950
I have 2n green balls.

1325
01:23:46,950 --> 01:23:50,630
I'm going to choose n minus
r green balls over here.

1326
01:23:50,630 --> 01:23:55,130
So these are the red balls
that I select and here

1327
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:57,420
are the green balls.

1328
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:59,500
Now we'll use the sum rule.

1329
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,760
And I add all the
different possible subsets

1330
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:05,310
with 0 red balls, with
1 red ball, 2 red balls,

1331
01:24:05,310 --> 01:24:07,960
all the way up to n red balls.

1332
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:19,360
So essentially, I get the
sum by the sum rule of r 0

1333
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:25,330
all the way up to n where I
count the number of subsets

1334
01:24:25,330 --> 01:24:27,730
with exactly r red balls.

1335
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:31,110
So that means I can choose
r out of the n red balls

1336
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:37,190
and another n minus r out of
the 2n balls-- 2n green balls.

1337
01:24:37,190 --> 01:24:39,360
So now we equate
those two together

1338
01:24:39,360 --> 01:24:41,430
and that proves the theorem.

1339
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:45,710
So the really hard part
in this type of proofs

1340
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:51,130
is that you need some creativity
to find and define that set S

1341
01:24:51,130 --> 01:24:53,020
and see how that would work.

1342
01:24:53,020 --> 01:24:56,230
And the way to do that usually
is to look at this equation

1343
01:24:56,230 --> 01:24:58,390
and then say, oh,
wait a minute, I'm

1344
01:24:58,390 --> 01:25:02,860
going to talk about sets because
I choose n out of 3n over here.

1345
01:25:02,860 --> 01:25:04,940
So out of 3n elements.

1346
01:25:04,940 --> 01:25:07,810
And maybe I can
divide up the sets

1347
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:09,780
in some kind of specific choice.

1348
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,540
So tomorrow during
recitation you

1349
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:15,630
will also see
combinatorial proof.

1350
01:25:15,630 --> 01:25:17,680
Thank you.

1351
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:23,551
