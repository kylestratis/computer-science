10
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,030
TOM LEIGHTON: Today
we're going to talk

11
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:29,560
about the concept
of independence.

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:41,760
In probability, we
say that an event A

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:01:00,210
is independent of an event B
if one of two conditions hold.

14
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:04,910
First, if the
probability of A given B

15
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,910
is just the same as
the probability of A

16
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:16,470
or if B can't happen, namely
the probability of B is 0.

17
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:22,450
In other words, A is independent
of B if knowing that B happened

18
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,060
doesn't change the probability
that A is going to happen.

19
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,720
So knowing that
this event occurs

20
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,460
doesn't influence the
probability that A occurs.

21
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,700
And there's a special case where
they're independent because you

22
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,820
know that B can't happen.

23
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,020
If the probability
of B happening is 0,

24
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,271
then everything is
independent of B.

25
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:47,260
Now, the typical
example that gets used

26
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,515
is when you flip two coins.

27
00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:53,970


28
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,525
So say we flip two
fair, independent coins.

29
00:01:59,525 --> 00:02:08,020


30
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:21,090
And let's let B be the event
that the first coin is heads

31
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,930
and that means that the
probability of B happening

32
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,040
is 1/2, because we've
assumed it's a fair coin,

33
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:36,110
and we'll let A be the event
that the second coin comes out

34
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,120
heads.

35
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,145
So we know the probability of
A is 1/2 because it's fair.

36
00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:45,180


37
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,300
And because they're
independent, we

38
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:55,460
can conclude that the
probability of A given B

39
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:01,780
is 1/2, which is the probability
of A. In other words,

40
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,830
seeing the result
of the second coin

41
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:09,190
doesn't tell you anything about
the result of the first coin.

42
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,300
Now actually, when
you flip two coins,

43
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,520
it's not just always the
case if they're independent.

44
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,240
Can anybody think
of an example where

45
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,550
you can flip a pair of coins
and they are dependent somehow,

46
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,771
they're not independent?

47
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:26,270
Yeah.

48
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:29,640
AUDIENCE: Well, if you have to
get two heads and two tails?

49
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,500
TOM LEIGHTON: If you have to
get two heads or two tails.

50
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,200
Well, how would you have to get?

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,426
AUDIENCE: The probability
of getting two heads

52
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:42,092
should be 1/4 [INAUDIBLE].

53
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:43,550
TOM LEIGHTON: Well,
then they would

54
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,015
be independent in that case.

55
00:03:45,015 --> 00:03:45,515
Yeah.

56
00:03:45,515 --> 00:03:47,223
AUDIENCE: If you glue
the coins together.

57
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:48,150
TOM LEIGHTON: Yeah.

58
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,160
I mean, this is a silly example,
but I got two fair coins here.

59
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,866
I could clip them together
and now I flip them

60
00:03:57,866 --> 00:04:00,490
and odds are pretty good they're
both going to be heads or both

61
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,990
be tails.

62
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,230
If you know what happened
to the right coin,

63
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,040
it will tell you what
happened to the left coin.

64
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,600
Now, that's a pretty
contrived example,

65
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,000
but it is illustrative of
what happens in practice.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,610
In practice, we
assume independence

67
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,329
even though there can
be subtle dependencies

68
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,620
and this could lead to trouble.

69
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,650
In fact, we're going to
give a lot of examples

70
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,090
where it leads to
trouble today and also

71
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,560
for the rest of the course.

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,390
Because we're always going to
want to assume independence

73
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,400
and when we do, we're going
to get very nice results,

74
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,820
but things aren't always
independent in practice

75
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:39,860
and establishing independence
is a hard thing to do.

76
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,930
For that matter, while
we're on the subject,

77
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,450
we always talk about fair coins.

78
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,650
You flip a coin and it's fair.

79
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,450
You know, that's not
always to either.

80
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:50,130
There's actually a
famous mathematician

81
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,100
named Persi Diaconis who used
to down the street at Harvard

82
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:58,070
and he came and
gave a talk one day

83
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,540
at MIT in the math department
and he's a probabalist.

84
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,830
He does probability theory
and is a very cool guy.

85
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,890
And so he flipped a coin,
got a quarter from somebody

86
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,400
in the audience and
flipped it and he

87
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,360
flip that I think 10 or
20 straight times all

88
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,900
the way to the roof,
caught it, turned it over.

89
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,812
Every time it was heads.

90
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:22,190
And he goes, now what's the
probability of that happening?

91
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,800
Well, you know, it's 1/2
to the 20th or whatever,

92
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,130
not very likely.

93
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,730
How could he always
make it come out heads?

94
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,780
Well, Persi was an unusual
guy and in fact, he'd

95
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,480
spent months in the strobe
lab over at Harvard practicing

96
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,794
to make it always rotate seven
times, three of them on the way

97
00:05:41,794 --> 00:05:43,460
up, one at the top,
and then three down.

98
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,280
And he could actually
see how many rotations it

99
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,420
had done to make
sure it was seven,

100
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,950
so it always came out heads.

101
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,560
Now, he is an unusual fellow.

102
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,360
He was 1 of 10 people
in the world that

103
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,482
could do a perfect shuffle
reliably on a deck of cards

104
00:06:00,482 --> 00:06:01,940
and that's a very
hard thing to do.

105
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,330
He said he had to practice 8
hours a day for over six months

106
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,722
to be able to do it every time.

107
00:06:07,722 --> 00:06:09,930
In fact, he gave another
talk at MIT where he came in

108
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,520
and he made magic tricks,
actually based on mathematics.

109
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,440
And you would cut a deck,
he would feel it like this

110
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,500
and tell you where you
cut, how many cards

111
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,390
were in the part you picked
up and then do his eight

112
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,215
perfect shuffles, which
is enough to return

113
00:06:24,215 --> 00:06:28,720
a normal 52-card deck back
to its original order.

114
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,170
And then using this,
he could play the game

115
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,360
where pick any card,
you stick it in,

116
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,719
he feels where the card went,
and then using mathematics,

117
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:39,260
he could shuffle
the deck eight times

118
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:42,670
and make the card come out
anywhere he wanted in the deck.

119
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,000
So he had a lot going
on upstairs too.

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,910
He had an interesting
life history.

121
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,880
He ran away from
home as a young child

122
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,150
and joined the traveling circus.

123
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,580
And then somehow from there, he
joined the faculty at Harvard.

124
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:01,190
You know, there's
an amazing story.

125
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,897
And actually your
story about Persi

126
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:06,190
is he was the first
guy to get kicked out

127
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,060
of casinos for card counting.

128
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:12,970
He figured that out way before
the MIT team and the movie 21.

129
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,720
Down in Puerto Rico,
he used to play

130
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,470
and then they finally figured
him out and he got booted.

131
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:26,230
So back to independence, let's
do another picture example.

132
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,720
Say that my sample
space looks like this

133
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,650
and I've got two events, A
and B and they look like this,

134
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,456
so they're dis-joined.

135
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,340
Are A and B independent?

136
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,410
No.

137
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:47,780
In fact what is the probability
of A given B as I've drawn it?

138
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,560
AUDIENCE: 0.

139
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,940
TOM LEIGHTON: 0.

140
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:54,371
Because if B occurs,
you're outside of A.

141
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:57,175
And so this does not
equal the probability of A

142
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:59,860
as long as it's not 0.

143
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,000
So disjoint events don't imply
that they're independent.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:12,730


145
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:15,840
Now, what's the picture
look like for them

146
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,630
to be independent?

147
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,926
What is the right
picture to draw here?

148
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:22,880
So I got my sample
space and say I

149
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,070
make this half the sample
space be A. Well, then B

150
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,110
to be independent,
would look something--

151
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,175
I didn't quite draw it.

152
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:35,309
I actually have it be 50-50.

153
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:41,860
So if a is 50% of S,
like this half, then

154
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,360
for A to be independent of
B, A intersect B, this part,

155
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,920
has to be 50% of B. Because
the probability of A given B

156
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,081
must equal the probability
of A to be independent.

157
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,330
So this would be a picture
where they are independent.

158
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,534


159
00:09:03,534 --> 00:09:04,950
Now, independent
events are really

160
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,490
nice to work with and
in part because they

161
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,170
have a very simple
rule for computing

162
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:15,070
the probability of an
intersection of events

163
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,015
and it's called the product
rule for independent events.

164
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:34,150


165
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:44,620
And that says that if
A is independent of B,

166
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:51,000
then the probability of
A and B or A intersect B

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,680
is just the product
of their probabilities

168
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,290
separately, the probability of
A times the probability of B.

169
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,530
So let's prove this.

170
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:05,630


171
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,390
And there's two cases, depending
on whether or not B can happen,

172
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:12,490
if the probability
of B is 0 or not.

173
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:18,880
So case 1 is B can't happen.

174
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,220
The probability of B is 0.

175
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,980
In this case, what's the
probability of A and B?

176
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:30,680


177
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,330
B can't happen.

178
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,170
0.

179
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:36,620
If B can't happen,
then they both can't.

180
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,800
You can't have both
of them happening

181
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:47,080
and that equals the probability
of A times the probability of B

182
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,670
because the
probability of B is 0.

183
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,730
So that case works.

184
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,170


185
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:58,010
Case 2 is the probability
of B is bigger than 0.

186
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,720


187
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,490
In that case, we have
the probability of A

188
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:10,980
and B, A intersect B,
well, from the definition,

189
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,390
is the probability of B times
the probability of A given

190
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,270
B. We did that last time.

191
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:24,370
And by independence, this
is just the probability of A

192
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:27,270
because A is independent
of B, so we're done.

193
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:33,280


194
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,420
In fact, many texts
will define independence

195
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,460
by this product rule.

196
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,990
Many texts will say
that A and B are

197
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,320
independent if this is true.

198
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,070
And it's equivalent,
it turns out.

199
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,810
We won't prove that here, but if
you use this as the definition,

200
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,084
then you can derive our
definition as a result.

201
00:11:54,084 --> 00:11:56,250
So this is an equivalent
definition of independence.

202
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,960


203
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,570
Another nice fact about
independent events

204
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,695
is that it's a
symmetric relationship.

205
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:12,210


206
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,925
It's called the symmetry
of independence.

207
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:26,330


208
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:34,540
That says that if they
A is independent of B,

209
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,440
then the reverse is true.

210
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:46,240
B is independent of A.
Now, we won't prove that.

211
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,590
It's actually easier
to see that it's true

212
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:52,380
if this were the
definition of independence

213
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,810
because A intersect
B is the same

214
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:59,750
as B intersect A and
multiplication is commutative.

215
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:03,980
So it's easier to see it if
we had used that definition.

216
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,150
So because of this
we often just say

217
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,760
A and B are independent
because it doesn't matter which

218
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,450
order you're taking them in.

219
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:19,171
All right, any questions
about the definition so far?

220
00:13:19,171 --> 00:13:19,970
All right.

221
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:21,520
Let's do some examples.

222
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:34,590


223
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,380
Let's say I have two
independent fair coins.

224
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:47,730


225
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,970
And I'm going to
have the event A be

226
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,520
the situation when the coins
match, both heads, both tails.

227
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:01,700


228
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:06,190
And B is going to be the event
that the first coin is heads.

229
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:12,420


230
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,350
And I want to know, are
A and B independent?

231
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,300


232
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,896
Are those independent events?

233
00:14:19,896 --> 00:14:22,995


234
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:27,650
Well, what's the
first answer to this?

235
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,290
I mean, A is event
the coins match.

236
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:33,670
B tells me what
the first coin was.

237
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,650
So the first inclination
here is that these

238
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,960
are dependent events
because I know something

239
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,760
about the first coin,
so that might tell me

240
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,510
something about the
probability they match.

241
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,080
There could be some
dependence here.

242
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,110
Now, in fact, because it's
set up, they're independent

243
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,390
and we can check that by
just doing the calculation,

244
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:59,220
computing the probability of A
given B. Maybe I can do that.

245
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,910
I'll do that here.

246
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:09,320
The probability of
A given B is, well,

247
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,190
the condition that they're
going to match given

248
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:14,370
that the first
point is heads means

249
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,280
it's the same as the
second coin being heads.

250
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:25,630
This is the probability the
second coin is heads and that's

251
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:30,732
just 1/2 because it's a
fair coin and independent

252
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:31,440
of the first one.

253
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:38,370
Now, the probability of A, by
itself, the events the coins

254
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,860
match, what's that?

255
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:40,670
How much is that?

256
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:48,230


257
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,855
What's the probability
the coins match?

258
00:15:49,855 --> 00:15:52,640


259
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,945
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

260
00:15:53,945 --> 00:15:55,680
TOM LEIGHTON: 1/4 plus 1/4.

261
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,020
I've got 1/4 chance
of heads, heads

262
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:03,670
1/4 chance of tails, tails,
so it's 1/2, so it works out.

263
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:08,340
The probability of A given B
equals the probability of A.

264
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,200
They're both 1/2.

265
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,770
So A and B are
independent events

266
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,400
because that's
just the definition

267
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,066
even though it looked like there
might have been some dependence

268
00:16:19,066 --> 00:16:21,170
lurking around here.

269
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:24,630
Now, this example that I just
did is a little misleading.

270
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,950
The intuition they
probably are dependent

271
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,970
actually is good
intuition in this case

272
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:37,351
because if I don't have fair
coins, they are dependent.

273
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:37,850
All right.

274
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,700
So in particular,
let's look at what

275
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:45,220
happens if the probability
of a heads is p

276
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,560
and the probability of tails
is 1 minus p for both coins.

277
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,070


278
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:55,730
So let's compute the
probability of A given

279
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,070
B. What is it in this case?

280
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:02,214


281
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:04,380
Well, it's the probability
the second coin is heads.

282
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:04,940
What's that?

283
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,319


284
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,700
p because both of them are
heads with probability, p.

285
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,109
They're independent still.

286
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:16,130
The two coins are independent.

287
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,369
And now let's look
at the probability

288
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:20,859
that the coins match.

289
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:22,530
Well, it's a probability
of heads, heads

290
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,520
and the probability
of tails, tails.

291
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:28,180
Heads, heads is p times p.

292
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,790
Tails, tails is 1
minus p squared.

293
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,050


294
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,840
So to independent, I
need this to equal that

295
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,330
or to have the
probability of B be 0.

296
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:50,730
So A and B are
independent if and only

297
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,880
if-- the first
case is probability

298
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:02,970
B is 0, which means
that p equals 0,

299
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,510
or that has to equal this.

300
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,470


301
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:15,770
So p would have to equal 1
minus 2p plus 2p squared,

302
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,420
just square that out there.

303
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,750
So let's solve this.

304
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:26,590
That happens if and only
if 0 equals 1 minus 3p

305
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,630
plus 2p squared.

306
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:34,090
That's true if and only if
0 equals-- I factor this--

307
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:40,170
it's 1 minus 2p times 1 minus
p and that's if and only

308
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:48,510
if p is 1/2 or p
is 1, two roots.

309
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,160
So if the coins are always
heads, they're independent.

310
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,040
If they're always tails,
the events are independent

311
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,300
or if they're fair coins, these
two events are independent.

312
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:04,280
But anything else, they're
not independent anymore.

313
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,320
Any questions?

314
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,970
And now you can sort
of see if the coins are

315
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:12,290
likely to be tails
and the first one

316
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,350
comes up heads, that should
influence the probability

317
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,361
the coins match.

318
00:19:17,361 --> 00:19:18,245
It should change.

319
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:21,220


320
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,290
Questions?

321
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:22,790
All right.

322
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,790
So there's a nice application
of this to getting

323
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,860
an edge in ultimate Frisbee.

324
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,400
Now, when you're
playing ultimate,

325
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,740
you've got to decide who
gets the Frisbee first.

326
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,590
And sometimes you don't have
a coin to flip, call heads

327
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,860
or tails, but you
do have the Frisbee.

328
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,950
Now, you could flip the Frisbee
and call right side up or not,

329
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,690
but the problem is the Frisbee
is known not to be a fair coin.

330
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,190
When you toss it
up in the air, it's

331
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,980
likely to wind up on, I
guess, the curved edge down.

332
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,690
So that wouldn't be fair
to call heads or tails.

333
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:00,240
So the standard solution
is to flip the two

334
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,520
Frisbees at the same
time or one Frisbee twice

335
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,570
and somebody calls
same or different,

336
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:11,440
that the two Frisbees both
come up on the same way

337
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,040
or they come up
different ways and then

338
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,000
if you called it right, you
get to start with a Frisbee.

339
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:22,700
And the idea behind this is
that that simulates a fair coin,

340
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:27,640
that the probability that
they're the same is 50-50.

341
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,390
What do you think.

342
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,060
Is that a fair way to
decide who starts first?

343
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,560
Yeah.

344
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,452
AUDIENCE: No.

345
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:34,510
TOM LEIGHTON: No.

346
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,500
Yeah, that's right.

347
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,740
It's not.

348
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:43,590
Now, it is in the case
when the coin was fair,

349
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,610
but we know the
Frisbee is not fair.

350
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:50,040
And in fact, you can see
this from this probability.

351
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:55,590
This is the probability
of a match, which

352
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:01,190
is fine at p equal
1/2, but in fact,

353
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,190
if you analyze
this equation, you

354
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,950
find out its minimum
value is at p equals 1/2

355
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:11,860
and as p starts moving away
from 1/2 towards 0 or to 1,

356
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,520
it gets bigger.

357
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,610
And we know that for
Frisbees, p is not 1/2.

358
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:23,562
This means that the probability
of a match is better than 50%.

359
00:21:23,562 --> 00:21:25,020
So if you're ever
playing ultimate,

360
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,343
always call same
because you're going

361
00:21:27,343 --> 00:21:29,260
to have a better than
50-50 chance of getting

362
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,720
to start with the Frisbee.

363
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,610
It's not a fair example.

364
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:35,390


365
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:38,000
There is another example
of how to make a fair coin

366
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,230
from a biased coin to an
unbiased coin in homework, ways

367
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,760
of doing this that are fair.

368
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,650
Because often you have
biased random numbers

369
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,827
and you want to get unbiased
or maybe you got a fair coin

370
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:52,660
and you want to make
something that comes up

371
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,570
heads with probability 1/3.

372
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:57,720
How do you actually do
that in a way that works?

373
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,880
Any questions on that?

374
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,210


375
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,190
The next example is from
the first OJ Simpson trial.

376
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:12,930
How many people here
know who OJ Simpson is?

377
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,610
OK, so he's still pretty famous.

378
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,340
Now, as you probably
know then he

379
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,040
was a famous football player.

380
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,500
Back when I was a kid, he
was a famous college player,

381
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,850
then he was a famous
pro player and then he

382
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:29,100
was an actor, famous actor.

383
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,430
And then he was accused of
murdering his wife in a gory

384
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,570
knifing and a friend
of his wife's.

385
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,060
And ultimately, the jury
found him not guilty,

386
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,820
but pretty much everybody in
the country thought he did it.

387
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,050
He looked really guilty.

388
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,870
And it was a big media event,
one of the first big trial

389
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,280
events on TV.

390
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,070
And so all the proceedings
were on TV and everybody

391
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,930
watched them.

392
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:57,580
We'd all go home to
watch the OJ hearing.

393
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,930
It was amazing.

394
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:03,270
Now, during the
indictment proceedings,

395
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,920
there was a huge dispute
over what independence

396
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:09,650
was and does it matter.

397
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,810
The issue arose when the
prosecution witness claimed

398
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,900
that only 1 in 200 Americans
had a certain blood type that

399
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,080
matched the blood type found at
the scene of the crime, which

400
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,450
was alleged to be OJ's blood.

401
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,030
And this was during
the indictment

402
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,720
and back then DNA
tests took a long time

403
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,590
and they weren't ready yet.

404
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:34,380
And the witness presented
the following facts and this

405
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:38,320
was the crime lab
guy, the police guy.

406
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:52,500


407
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:59,355
He said that 1 in 10 people,
roughly, matched type O blood.

408
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:04,000


409
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,355
And that 1 in 5 people matched
the Rh factor positive.

410
00:24:10,355 --> 00:24:13,910


411
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:20,402
And that 1 in 4 people match a
certain kind of marker, which

412
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:21,610
I don't remember what it was.

413
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:26,920
We'll just call it marker XYZ,
some other factor of the blood.

414
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:33,370
And then this conclusion was
that this means that 1 in 200

415
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:40,720
match all three factors.

416
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,970
And this seems reasonable
because there's

417
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:49,920
1/10 of the people have O, if 15
of them have positive Rh factor

418
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,400
and then 1/4 of
all of those have

419
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,430
this marker, that's 1 in 200.

420
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,810
Now, it's important
because OJ's blood

421
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:07,310
and the blood at the crime
scene both matched all three.

422
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,720
So the implication,
of course, is

423
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,620
that OJ is looking like
the guy who did it.

424
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:16,670
And the question was, well,
is the 1 in 200 really true?

425
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,060
We can sample these
three in the populations

426
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:23,850
and see they're true, but
is 1 in 200 really true?

427
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,660
Now, it would be if,
in fact, we verified

428
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,700
that 1/5 of the
type O people have

429
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,480
positive and 1/4 of
the O positive people

430
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,500
have the XYZ marker.

431
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,230
But well, we don't necessarily
know that unless we

432
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,820
go figure that out.

433
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,030
If you assume
they're independent,

434
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,192
then it would be true.

435
00:25:46,192 --> 00:25:47,900
The product rule will
tell us that if you

436
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,280
assume they're independent.

437
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:55,290
So during the trial, a special
math defense counsel showed up,

438
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,790
not part of the
normal defense team,

439
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:00,480
but he was brought in as
a mathematician and lawyer

440
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,570
and he crosses the
police guy on the stand.

441
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,480
And he asked the
police guy, the lab guy

442
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,350
if it is known that these
three factors are independent.

443
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,162
Well, the poor
police lab guy never

444
00:26:15,162 --> 00:26:16,870
heard the word
independent before, didn't

445
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:20,380
know what it meant and the
defense counsel proceeded

446
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,310
to crucify him on the stand.

447
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,310
And then in the end, all
he could say was, look,

448
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,226
we just get these things
and we multiply them.

449
00:26:26,226 --> 00:26:29,500
That's what we're
supposed to do.

450
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,950
It was a little scary.

451
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:33,120
The actual transcript--
you can still get it--

452
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,620
is a little scary.

453
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,990
The same problem arises
today with DNA testing.

454
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,880
Only there, you've got
lots of these things

455
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,720
and you multiply
them all together

456
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,210
and you get
probabilities like one

457
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:50,260
in many billion
probability of a match.

458
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,410
Now, there's probably a higher
level of science going on

459
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:56,370
with DNA testing,
but it's even harder

460
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:59,440
to really establish
independence.

461
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,560
If you assume it, fine.

462
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,690
The math works out great.

463
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:04,280
You just multiply them together.

464
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,840
But how do you know
it's really true?

465
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,330
How do you know that maybe a lot
of people that have those four

466
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:14,120
markers and DNA don't happen
to just have the fifth also,

467
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,160
but it really is
totally unrelated.

468
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,210
And to know that
for sure, you got

469
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:23,060
to test hundreds of millions of
people, which we really haven't

470
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,320
done yet, and not just
a few guys in Detroit

471
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,280
to be able to conclude
independence of 1

472
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,800
in a billion probabilities.

473
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,160
So for us, this is a lot easier.

474
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,826
In the classroom, we
assume independence

475
00:27:34,826 --> 00:27:37,550
and we'll keep doing
that left and right,

476
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:40,620
but it doesn't mean
it's true in reality.

477
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,380
In fact, in the
last week of class.

478
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,720
We'll talk about how false
assumption of independence

479
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,490
on mortgage failures led to
the subprime mortgage disaster

480
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,780
in the recession.

481
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,162
It was all because of
some mathematics mistakes

482
00:27:54,162 --> 00:27:54,870
that people made.

483
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,530


484
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:59,910
Now, this example
raises the question of,

485
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,319
what does independence mean when
you have more than two events?

486
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,360
We defined independence
when there is two events,

487
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,280
but here there's three.

488
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,450
And so to be careful, we
got to actually define

489
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:16,010
dependence among more than
two events and in this case,

490
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:20,990
we talk about the events as
being mutually independent.

491
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,090
So let me define that.

492
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:36,770


493
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:44,330
So if I've got events
A1, A2, up to An,

494
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:56,120
we say they are
mutually independent if,

495
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:02,490
and this is a little complicated
notation, but for all i

496
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:10,740
and for all sets j that
are subsets of the events,

497
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:19,380
but not including i,
then the probability

498
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:23,890
that the i-th event occurs
given that all the events

499
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:29,010
in the subset
occurred, is the same

500
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:33,280
as the probability of the i-th
event occurring by itself.

501
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,570
Or there's a special
case where the chance

502
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,100
the other events occur is 0.

503
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:46,710


504
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,740
In other words, a
collection of events

505
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:52,220
is mutually independent
if any knowledge

506
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:55,960
about any of the rest of the
events, happening or not,

507
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,470
does not influence the
event you're looking

508
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,970
at for each of those events.

509
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,080
So no information about
any of the other markers

510
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,980
the blood influences the
i-th marker for any i.

511
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,770
The probabilities are unchanged.

512
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:11,710
Now, there's an equivalent
definitions based

513
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,691
and the product rule.

514
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:16,860
Let me show you that version
because that's easier

515
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,734
to work with usually.

516
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:32,850


517
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:43,880
This is the product
rule form and it

518
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:50,550
says that A1, A2, up
to An are mutually

519
00:30:50,550 --> 00:31:07,560
independent if for any
subset of the events

520
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,880
the probability of each of those
events in the subset happening,

521
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:18,364
all them happening,
is simply the product

522
00:31:18,364 --> 00:31:19,780
of their individual
probabilities.

523
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:26,810


524
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:30,910
So independence
means that if you

525
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,430
want the probability of a
bunch of events occurring,

526
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,996
just multiply them
out individually.

527
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:37,370
And that follows
for independence

528
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,600
or it could be the
definition of independence,

529
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,080
depending on how
you want to do it.

530
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,496
So either of these
are good enough

531
00:31:42,496 --> 00:31:47,200
for you to use as a definition
or a result for independence.

532
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,030
And so the blood guy, of course,
is just multiplying them out

533
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,390
because they're assumed
to be independent,

534
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,180
so it's OK that way.

535
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,125
Let's do an example.

536
00:31:56,125 --> 00:32:08,920


537
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,900
So for example, say
we have three events.

538
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:15,160


539
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:25,430
A1, A2, and A3 are
mutually independent

540
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:28,450
if, these are the things
you have to check,

541
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:35,144
probability A1 and A2
is just the probability

542
00:32:35,144 --> 00:32:36,560
of A1 times the
probability of A2.

543
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,160


544
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,900
Then you'd check that the
probability of A1 and A3

545
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,390
is the product of their
probabilities, A1 and A3.

546
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:54,170


547
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:57,250
And you'd check the
probability of A2

548
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,460
and A3 is the product
of their probabilities.

549
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:06,050


550
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:07,550
And there's one
more thing to check.

551
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:10,290
What's that?

552
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,120
All of them.

553
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:23,090
The probability of all of them
is the product of each of them

554
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:23,845
together here.

555
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:27,940


556
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,870
So if you want to show
the three events are

557
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,410
mutually independent, these
are the four things you check.

558
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:37,598
That's one way to do it, which
is the case of the blood typing

559
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,306
in the situation.

560
00:33:38,306 --> 00:33:40,816


561
00:33:40,816 --> 00:33:41,530
All right.

562
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,630
Let's do an example.

563
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:49,470


564
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,510
Well, for example, if
I flip three unbiased,

565
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,290
mutually independent coins.

566
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:58,170
The probability of two of
them being heads is 1/4.

567
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,760
The probability of three being
heads is 1/8 and so forth.

568
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,010


569
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,750
Let's do a trickier example.

570
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:12,000
This is a question that was on
the final exam a few years ago

571
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,340
and a lot of the
class missed it.

572
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:16,630
So now we'll do it here.

573
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:21,610


574
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:36,719
Say I flip three fair, mutually
independent coins and my events

575
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:45,380
are going to be A1 is the
event coin 1 matches coin 2.

576
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:51,449


577
00:34:51,449 --> 00:34:54,730
The second event,
A2, is the event

578
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:59,420
that coin 2 matches coin 3.

579
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,750
And the third event,
A3, is the event

580
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,865
that coin 3 matches coin 1.

581
00:35:06,865 --> 00:35:09,980


582
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:15,180
And the question was,
are these three events

583
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,040
mutually independent?

584
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,040
Prove your answer.

585
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,345
Let's try to figure that out.

586
00:35:22,345 --> 00:35:31,852


587
00:35:31,852 --> 00:35:33,810
The coins, of course,
are mutually independent,

588
00:35:33,810 --> 00:35:36,150
but what about these events?

589
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,640
So let's start doing it.

590
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:41,370
What's the probability one
of the events occurring?

591
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:44,510


592
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:49,829
Well, you got to get the
two coins at hand to match,

593
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:51,370
so that's the
probability of a heads,

594
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:56,710
heads plus the probability
of a tails, tails.

595
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,580
That's 1/4 plus 1/4 equals 1/2.

596
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,920


597
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:13,280
Now, the probability of Ai
and Aj, i and j are 1 to 3,

598
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,740
they're different,
but what is a way

599
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,120
of characterizing that case?

600
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,520
Say event 1 occurred
and event 2 occurred,

601
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,770
how would I characterize that?

602
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:28,111


603
00:36:28,111 --> 00:36:28,610
Yeah.

604
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:29,782
AUDIENCE: All the same.

605
00:36:29,782 --> 00:36:30,913
TOM LEIGHTON: All of them.

606
00:36:30,913 --> 00:36:31,412
Yeah.

607
00:36:31,412 --> 00:36:34,410
All of the coins are the same
because if A1 and A2 occur,

608
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:37,290
I know 1 matches
2 a 2 matches 3.

609
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:40,910
If A1 and A3 happen, 1
matches 2 and 1 matches 3,

610
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,830
so they're all the same
and the same for A2 and A3.

611
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:46,630
If 2 matches 3 and 3 matches
1, they're all the same.

612
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:50,430
So this is the same as saying
all three coins are the same.

613
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,890


614
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:57,160
It could all be heads
or all be tails.

615
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,290
And that's an 8
plus 8, which is 1/4

616
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:07,900
and that means equals
the probability of Ai

617
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,780
times the probability
of Aj, which is

618
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:15,850
what I need for independence.

619
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:19,070
And then they said they're done.

620
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:23,520
They are independent,
the three events.

621
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,640
You like that answer?

622
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,260
What's missing?

623
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,410
The last case.

624
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,889
They didn't check
the last case and we

625
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:33,680
got to do that to have
mutual independence.

626
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,681
So let's look at that.

627
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:42,060
The last case is probability
A1 intersect A2 intersect A3.

628
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,180
What is the probability
that all three events occur?

629
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:49,950


630
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:55,560
Well, the coins all
have to match, right?

631
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,816
If all the coins match, all
three events occur, right?

632
00:37:59,816 --> 00:38:01,690
And what's the probability
all 3 coins match?

633
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,260


634
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,770
1/4, just the same
as this, is 1/4.

635
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:12,090
Does that equal probability
of A1 times the probability

636
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,520
of A2 times the
probability of A3?

637
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,090


638
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,120
What's that?

639
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,680
1/8.

640
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,620
This is 1/8.

641
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,590
They are not equal.

642
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,270


643
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,779
They are not mutually
independent events.

644
00:38:32,779 --> 00:38:33,725
All right?

645
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:37,520


646
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,702
Any questions about that?

647
00:38:39,702 --> 00:38:42,810
It might well be something like
this on the final this year,

648
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,960
a good, decent chance.

649
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,610
So if you start going along,
looks like they're independent,

650
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,735
but you forget to check
that last case, which shows

651
00:38:49,735 --> 00:38:52,580
they're not mutual independent.

652
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:56,140
So you've got to check for all
pairs and all subsets of events

653
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,140
for mutual independence.

654
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:00,040


655
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,960
Any questions about that?

656
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,370


657
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:09,960
Now, this is actually
an interesting example

658
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,690
because in this case, all
pairs were independent

659
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:18,800
and when that happens, we give
that a special name and it's

660
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,415
called pairwise independence,
not too surprising.

661
00:39:22,415 --> 00:39:26,180
And that can be
useful because there's

662
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,340
many times where you do
get pairwise independence,

663
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,502
but not mutual independence.

664
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:31,960
So let me give you
that definition.

665
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:38,760


666
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,460
So a collection of
events A1 through An

667
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:55,610
are said to be
pairwise independent

668
00:39:55,610 --> 00:40:04,980
if for all i and j,
where i doesn't equal j,

669
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,330
Ai and Aj are independent.

670
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:14,230


671
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:17,620
Now, as we saw in this
example, in this example,

672
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:21,660
it was pairwise independence
because the probability

673
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:25,490
of Ai and Aj equaled the
probability of Ai times

674
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,460
the probably of Aj.

675
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,130
For any pair, it was true.

676
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,130
But it doesn't imply
mutual independence.

677
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,160
So pairwise does
not imply mutual.

678
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,870


679
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:41,240
Mutual would imply
pairwise because it's

680
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,515
true for every subset of events.

681
00:40:43,515 --> 00:40:46,550


682
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,050
All right.

683
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:53,670
So let's go back for OJ and
see what would have happened.

684
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,990
What can you say about
the probability of a blood

685
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:59,420
match for a random
person if you only

686
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,230
knew that these factors
were pairwise independent?

687
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,910


688
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,182
Say you only knew that.

689
00:41:06,182 --> 00:41:08,140
You didn't know they were
mutually independent,

690
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,723
but you knew they were pairwise
independent in the population.

691
00:41:10,723 --> 00:41:14,959


692
00:41:14,959 --> 00:41:17,000
What's the best you can
say about the probability

693
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,130
a random person matches that
blood profile, an upper bound

694
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:23,315
on the probability?

695
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:23,815
Yeah.

696
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,776
AUDIENCE: 1 in 50.

697
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:26,100
TOM LEIGHTON: 1 in 50.

698
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,050
Yeah.

699
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,810
So what you can say is 1
in 50, but nothing better.

700
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,785
So let's see why 1 in 50 works.

701
00:41:32,785 --> 00:41:38,490


702
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:43,370
So let's let M1 be the
event you match here,

703
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,490
M2 be the event you
match their, and M3

704
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:48,300
be the event you match that.

705
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:55,000
The probability you
match all three is

706
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,600
upper bounded by
the probability you

707
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:03,360
match the first two
because matching all three

708
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,230
is a subset of this.

709
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:08,220


710
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,390
Pairwise independence
means that this is true.

711
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,690
This equals the
probability of matching

712
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,719
the first times the probability
of matching the second.

713
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:18,260
The probability of
matching the first

714
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:22,690
is 1/10, probably of
matching the second is 1/5,

715
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,465
so this is 1/50.

716
00:42:23,465 --> 00:42:26,700


717
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,880
And you picked the best two.

718
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,810
You could have picked these two
and said it was at most 1/20

719
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:38,070
or those two and said
it's at most 1/40.

720
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:41,760
But you were clever and said,
OK, I'm going to take these two

721
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,590
and use that as my upper
bound, which is 1/50.

722
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:51,450
And it might well be that 1
in 50 people match all three.

723
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:54,010
That can well be.

724
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:57,910
Because maybe whenever you're O
positive, you have marker XYZ.

725
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,725
That's possible, potentially,
unless we find out otherwise.

726
00:43:01,725 --> 00:43:05,830


727
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:10,149
What if I tell you can't
assume any independence at all?

728
00:43:10,149 --> 00:43:12,440
What can you say about the
probability of a blood match

729
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,400
here for a random person?

730
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:14,900
Yeah.

731
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:15,525
AUDIENCE: 1/10.

732
00:43:15,525 --> 00:43:16,566
TOM LEIGHTON: What is it?

733
00:43:16,566 --> 00:43:17,270
AUDIENCE: 1/10.

734
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:19,500
TOM LEIGHTON: 1/10.

735
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,230
Because if they
match all three, they

736
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:26,470
match this and that probability
is 1/10, so it's at most 1/10.

737
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,970
And it could be
that everybody who's

738
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:31,810
O is O positive and has XYZ.

739
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,704
So unless you have
more information,

740
00:43:34,704 --> 00:43:35,870
that's the best you can say.

741
00:43:35,870 --> 00:43:38,822
It might well be
that's the answer.

742
00:43:38,822 --> 00:43:41,720


743
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:46,120
Any questions about that?

744
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,600
So the assumptions
really matter.

745
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,200
The more independence
you assume,

746
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:53,370
the better bounds and the
probability you get of a match.

747
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:57,106


748
00:43:57,106 --> 00:43:58,660
It's a little bit
unrelated to this,

749
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,990
but there was another
mathematics dispute

750
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:03,380
at the OJ trial.

751
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,750
It turned out the that
OJ had been beating up

752
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,479
Nicole on a fairly regular basis
and there were police records

753
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,020
because after he'd
beat her up, she'd

754
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,250
go in and complain
to the police.

755
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:18,410
And the prosecution wanted this
evidence admitted at the trial

756
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:22,410
because if the guy
is a wife beater,

757
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,030
it makes you think that
maybe he killed her.

758
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:28,810
And the defense lawyers argued
against admitting that evidence

759
00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:33,070
because it wasn't tied to the
actual murder scene in any way

760
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:35,900
and they argued it would
be prejudicial to the jury

761
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:39,380
because, of course, if the jury
hears that OJ was beating her,

762
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,650
they might be more likely
to include to convict him

763
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,690
for murdering her.

764
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:46,620
Now, they got the
math council again

765
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:50,420
to argue that the reason
you shouldn't admit this

766
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,160
is because the
probability that you

767
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:02,350
kill your wife, that's K, given
that you batter your wife,

768
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:07,622
that's B, is 1 in 2,000.

769
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:09,080
I would have guessed
it was higher,

770
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,680
but the evidence did show that.

771
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,250
And so they said, look, there's
only a 1 in 2,000 chance

772
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,640
that this evidence of
wife beating is relevant

773
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,190
and therefore, it should not
be admitted because there's

774
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,170
a pretty decent chance
if the jury hears this,

775
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:27,340
they're going to convict him.

776
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,702
That's a pretty good argument.

777
00:45:28,702 --> 00:45:30,660
And usually that kind of
thing, you exclude it.

778
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:31,090
Yeah.

779
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:32,455
AUDIENCE: Where did
that number come from?

780
00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:34,880
TOM LEIGHTON: They got
some study and some experts

781
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,932
to come in and say that for
every 2,000 wife beaters,

782
00:45:38,932 --> 00:45:40,640
only one of them
actually kills his wife.

783
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,340


784
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,179
Now, what do you suppose
the prosecution argued back?

785
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:49,970
They actually argued
back very effectively,

786
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:53,031
because that's a tough
argument to get by.

787
00:45:53,031 --> 00:45:53,530
Yeah.

788
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,105
AUDIENCE: What's the probability
that you kill your wife

789
00:45:56,105 --> 00:46:00,545
in the first place, that could
be 100 times larger than usual.

790
00:46:00,545 --> 00:46:02,900
TOM LEIGHTON: Well,
that's a good point.

791
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,210
So maybe the probability
of killing your wife

792
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:11,370
not knowing B, I hope is
pretty small, probably

793
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:15,534
that's very small,
but I don't know.

794
00:46:15,534 --> 00:46:17,450
But in any case, this
thing you're going from,

795
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:20,650
say it's 1 in 1 million
to 1 in 2,000, 1 in 2,000

796
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:25,084
is still too small to be used
as evidence that OJ did it.

797
00:46:25,084 --> 00:46:27,137
AUDIENCE: Frequency he did it.

798
00:46:27,137 --> 00:46:29,220
TOM LEIGHTON: Frequency,
they didn't get into that

799
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,840
because I guess he'd done it a
bunch, but that's a good point.

800
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,720
It could be there's
multiple beatings is higher.

801
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,285
Maybe that's 1 in 200 then.

802
00:46:37,285 --> 00:46:39,160
In fact, that may be
the case because I think

803
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,326
there's probably they say
because if you do it once,

804
00:46:41,326 --> 00:46:42,870
you do it multiple times.

805
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,940
So there's not much more
to be gaining there.

806
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,760
There's a critical
piece of information

807
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,276
we've left out of our
conditional probabilities here.

808
00:46:50,276 --> 00:46:54,297
In fact, the most glaring
piece of all of evidence.

809
00:46:54,297 --> 00:46:55,130
What's missing here?

810
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:56,440
What haven't we factored in?

811
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:56,940
Yeah.

812
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,840
AUDIENCE: The probability of B.

813
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:03,490
TOM LEIGHTON: The probability
of B, that's the battering.

814
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:07,550
Battering, I don't know what
it is, probably a large number.

815
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:09,450
Defense would argue
it's large, I guess,

816
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:13,664
but it shouldn't
matter that much.

817
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,010
AUDIENCE: The probability
that he actually beat her,

818
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,755
given that she threatened him?

819
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:20,130
TOM LEIGHTON:
Well, there's that,

820
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:21,949
but they have police--
well, that's true.

821
00:47:21,949 --> 00:47:23,740
They didn't see him
doing it, but let's say

822
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,820
that they had good
evidence that he did it

823
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:30,750
and defense wasn't arguing
that he didn't really beat her.

824
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:35,770
The key thing we're missing
here is Nicole wound up dead.

825
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,780
She was dead.

826
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,790
And there's another stat here
that the prosecution argued.

827
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:52,040


828
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,730
So they argued this fact.

829
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,570
The probability the
husband kills his wife,

830
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:00,980
given that he batters her
and she wound up dead,

831
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:05,100
that somebody murder
her is bigger than 1/2.

832
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:08,950
So here M is somebody
murdered the wife.

833
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:11,030
Here, the husband beats her.

834
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:13,110
Now, the conditional
probability that he

835
00:48:13,110 --> 00:48:16,540
killed her is bigger than
1/2 and that's a whopper.

836
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,504
Now, it's very relevant.

837
00:48:18,504 --> 00:48:19,920
The probability
he killed her just

838
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,290
given that he beat her
is only 1 in 2,000,

839
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:25,230
but if you add the fact, which
is very relevant in this case,

840
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:30,085
that the wife was murdered,
this is now very compelling.

841
00:48:30,085 --> 00:48:31,960
Now, in fact, they should
have really compare

842
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:39,840
this to probability he kills
her given that she's dead.

843
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:43,430
And so that would determine now
the relevance of the battering,

844
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:45,218
the wife beating.

845
00:48:45,218 --> 00:48:47,342
That's what they should
have done, but they didn't.

846
00:48:47,342 --> 00:48:49,845
They got this far and they
had that and the judge said,

847
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:51,610
I'm letting it in.

848
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,450
So it came in at that point.

849
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:55,600
But this would be the
right comparison, I think.

850
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,058
Because you look
at the probability

851
00:48:57,058 --> 00:49:00,287
that you killed her
given that she's dead,

852
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:02,120
but now the additional
information, the wife

853
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,227
battering, how does that
change the probability?

854
00:49:04,227 --> 00:49:05,810
And it probably
changes it materially.

855
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:08,480


856
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,450
So it's all a little
gory, but it's

857
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,624
interesting to see how
mathematics played out

858
00:49:13,624 --> 00:49:14,790
in this kind of environment.

859
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:15,289
Yeah.

860
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:17,455
AUDIENCE: Are we supposed
to assume that he did

861
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:18,814
kill his wife?

862
00:49:18,814 --> 00:49:20,700
TOM LEIGHTON: Yes,
and they assumed that,

863
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,170
but when you decide whether
or not to admit evidence,

864
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:27,850
if it's prejudicial, you've got
to have a really good grounds

865
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:28,410
to get it in.

866
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:31,710
Like if the evidence is going to
make the jury think he did it,

867
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:35,480
then you really got to argue the
evidence is relevant somehow.

868
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,649
There's material
information and that's

869
00:49:37,649 --> 00:49:38,690
what the fight was about.

870
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,740
A 1 in 2,000 relevance
isn't going to cut it.

871
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:45,569
1 in 2, that's probably
pretty relevant.

872
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:47,110
And that will be
the grounds on which

873
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,349
the judge makes his decision.

874
00:49:49,349 --> 00:49:50,890
But yeah, you assume
he didn't do it.

875
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:56,256


876
00:49:56,256 --> 00:49:56,860
All right.

877
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:57,830
Back to independence.

878
00:49:57,830 --> 00:50:03,410
So the last example today is
derived from a famous paradox

879
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:05,470
and has several actually
important applications

880
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:06,880
in computer science.

881
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,340
And this problem is known
as the birthday problem

882
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:10,340
or the birthday paradox.

883
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,170


884
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:16,040
It's a paradox because it sort
of has a surprising answer.

885
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,091


886
00:50:20,091 --> 00:50:21,590
Probably a lot of
you have seen this

887
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,318
before in some form or another.

888
00:50:23,318 --> 00:50:37,860


889
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:45,180
In the birthday problem,
there are N birthdays

890
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,680
and typically
we're going to look

891
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:53,290
at the case where N is
365, the days of the year,

892
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:54,350
and there is M people.

893
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:59,330


894
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,570
And for example, know maybe
there's 100 people here.

895
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:07,070


896
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:15,480
And what we want to know
is, what is the probability

897
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:21,770
that two or more people
have the same birthday.

898
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:32,760


899
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,260
For example, how
many people think

900
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,450
there's at least a 50%
chance that a pair of you

901
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:41,460
in the audience here
have the same birthday?

902
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:42,870
That's good.

903
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:48,030
How many people think there's
a better than 90% chance?

904
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:49,382
A few of you.

905
00:51:49,382 --> 00:51:49,930
All right.

906
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:53,410
How many people think there's
a better than a 99% chance

907
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:55,700
that there's a pair
of matching birthdays?

908
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,950
A couple left.

909
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:01,060
How many think it's better
than a 99.9% chance?

910
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:01,974
We've got one, two.

911
00:52:01,974 --> 00:52:03,390
You guys are going
to be stubborn.

912
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:03,990
Another one.

913
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:04,500
All right.

914
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:11,770
How many people think it's
more than 99.999% chance?

915
00:52:11,770 --> 00:52:13,340
Actually it's six 9's.

916
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,440
It's incredible.

917
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,120
It is a virtual certainty.

918
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,200
So let's see.

919
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:23,170
In fact, the chance that
you're all different is about 1

920
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:27,290
in 3 million chance that
you're all different.

921
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:30,810
And we're going to see
why that's true here.

922
00:52:30,810 --> 00:52:33,410
But to do that, we're
going to need to make

923
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:36,720
two important assumptions.

924
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,850
Any ideas about what assumptions
you're going to need?

925
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:40,350
Yeah.

926
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:42,170
AUDIENCE: Birthdays are
uniformly distributed.

927
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:43,585
TOM LEIGHTON: Birthdays
are uniformly distributed.

928
00:52:43,585 --> 00:52:44,718
Any other ideas?

929
00:52:44,718 --> 00:52:45,218
Yes.

930
00:52:45,218 --> 00:52:46,496
AUDIENCE: He stole my answer.

931
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,870
TOM LEIGHTON: Oh,
he stole yours.

932
00:52:47,870 --> 00:52:50,724
What else are you going
to need to assume?

933
00:52:50,724 --> 00:52:51,700
Yeah.

934
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:54,319
AUDIENCE: All birthdays are
independent of each other.

935
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,110
TOM LEIGHTON: Yeah.

936
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,410
Mutually independent.

937
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:58,380
We're going to
need that as well.

938
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:03,020
Now, in actuality, neither
is true in reality.

939
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,870
It's well known
that birthdays tend

940
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:07,700
to follow seasonal
patterns and they're

941
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,070
related to major events.

942
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:13,590
Now, do you all remember the big
blackout that hit the Northeast

943
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:14,830
several years ago?

944
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,710
Do you remember that?

945
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:18,660
Well, it turns out,
this is a true fact,

946
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,850
there were a lot of babies
born nine months later.

947
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,020
In fact, they had a name.

948
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,730
They're called blackout babies.

949
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:27,950
If you were born in that period
in the Northeast and there's

950
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:31,770
all these news stories about
the life of the blackout babies.

951
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:34,370
And the same thing happens
after cold snaps in the winter

952
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:36,860
and you get a blizzard
or this kind of a thing.

953
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,150
Nine months later,
you get babies.

954
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:44,040
In fact, I had a personal
experience with this.

955
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:51,090
Well, my son was born
on October 18, 1996.

956
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:54,100
And on the day he was born,
we're going to the hospital

957
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,720
and it was a zoo.

958
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,190
The maternity ward
was totally full.

959
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:01,050
We had to go at some other
wing of the hospital.

960
00:54:01,050 --> 00:54:05,300
And babies were popping
out all over the place.

961
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,040
And I asked, what is going on?

962
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,520
Why don't you have enough
room for all the mothers here?

963
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,520
And they said, oh, it's
all the blizzard babies.

964
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:13,790
And I go, what?

965
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:16,100
And they go, well, remember
the blizzard of '96?

966
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,562
It's like, oh yeah.

967
00:54:18,562 --> 00:54:19,528
I remember.

968
00:54:19,528 --> 00:54:20,980
Yeah.

969
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,930
It was nine months prior
is the big blizzard

970
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:28,000
and so it's all the
blizzard babies coming.

971
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,122
So they're not uniform.

972
00:54:30,122 --> 00:54:31,830
They're all different
probabilities here,

973
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:33,965
but we're going to assume
they're equally likely.

974
00:54:33,965 --> 00:54:36,570


975
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:41,920
Now, independence is also
not true, in general.

976
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:47,210
What's one way that birthdays
might not be independent?

977
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:47,935
What is it?

978
00:54:47,935 --> 00:54:48,601
AUDIENCE: Twins.

979
00:54:48,601 --> 00:54:49,540
TOM LEIGHTON: Twins.

980
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:52,500
So if they're twins, they
have the same birthday.

981
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:53,500
Now, there's other ways.

982
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,990
In fact, my only
sibling, my brother,

983
00:54:56,990 --> 00:55:00,880
has the same birthday I do,
but I'm two years older,

984
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,680
so we weren't twins.

985
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,780
Now, you say, what
are the odds of that?

986
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:10,200
Well, 1 in 365, you think.

987
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,800
Well, one day I'm
in middle school,

988
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,040
about the age you start
thinking about these things,

989
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,060
and you get the idea to
count back nine months

990
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,160
from your birthday.

991
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,940
Probably some of
you have done that.

992
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:24,490
And I did that and
that's my dad's birthday.

993
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:25,914
I was like, oh.

994
00:55:25,914 --> 00:55:28,520


995
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,100
May is not 1 in 365.

996
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,810
It's like, Happy Birthday.

997
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:36,860
I don't know.

998
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,160
Anyway, I almost needed to
go into therapy after that,

999
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,800
you know.

1000
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:45,810
So now you all got to count back
nine months from your birthday.

1001
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:49,100
Anybody whose birthday is on
September 30 or October 1,

1002
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:51,360
nine months back
is New Year's Eve.

1003
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:53,100
That's dangerous.

1004
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:57,100
So in reality, birthdays
are not independent

1005
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,610
and they are not
randomly distributed,

1006
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,280
but we're going to
assume that because we're

1007
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:05,510
going to use this same analysis
for computer science problems

1008
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:09,831
where things are, hopefully,
more independent and random.

1009
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:11,330
Now, we're going
to do an experiment

1010
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,502
to see how many people
it takes us to get

1011
00:56:14,502 --> 00:56:15,710
a pair of matching birthdays.

1012
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:18,220
So I'm going to run through
people in order in the rows

1013
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,440
here, get your birthday
and we're going to record

1014
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,680
and we're going to see how
far we go until there's

1015
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,880
a match in that group.

1016
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,370
So I will write up
the months here.

1017
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:51,230


1018
00:56:51,230 --> 00:56:55,950
And we'll start with my
birthday is October 28.

1019
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,180
So let's go right across.

1020
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:57,830
What yours?

1021
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:59,120
AUDIENCE: April 1.

1022
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,230
TOM LEIGHTON: April 1.

1023
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:06,610


1024
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:07,260
OK.

1025
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,810
We won't embarrass you here.

1026
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:10,930
OK, who's next?

1027
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,283
What's your birthday?

1028
00:57:12,283 --> 00:57:13,672
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

1029
00:57:13,672 --> 00:57:14,600
September 2.

1030
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:15,910
TOM LEIGHTON: September 2.

1031
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:18,020
All right.

1032
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:18,907
Yours.

1033
00:57:18,907 --> 00:57:19,615
AUDIENCE: June 1.

1034
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:22,380
TOM LEIGHTON: June 1.

1035
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:22,880
OK.

1036
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:23,560
We'll come back.

1037
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:24,310
AUDIENCE: April 8.

1038
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:24,940
TOM LEIGHTON: What is it?

1039
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:25,880
AUDIENCE: April 8.

1040
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,481
TOM LEIGHTON: April 8.

1041
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:28,954
All right.

1042
00:57:28,954 --> 00:57:30,427
AUDIENCE: November 20.

1043
00:57:30,427 --> 00:57:32,992

01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,864
I'm going to have to ask

1144
01:00:35,864 --> 01:00:37,110
twice here to get a match.

1145
01:00:37,110 --> 01:00:38,150

1146
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:39,460

AUDIENCE: Did ask how many--

1151
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,452
AUDIENCE: September 3.

1152
01:00:48,452 --> 01:00:50,460
TOM LEIGHTON: September 3.

1153
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,545
All right.

1154
01:00:52,545 --> 01:00:55,275
Very good.

1155
01:00:55,275 --> 01:00:56,190
All right.

1156
01:00:56,190 --> 01:01:00,230
Let's count and see
how many we got here.

1157
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:02,912
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1158
01:01:02,912 --> 01:01:08,960
9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

1159
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:19,060
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,
29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,

1160
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:22,630
37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42.

1161
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:24,360
That is a record.

1162
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:29,230
So it took 42 people
to get a match.

1163
01:01:29,230 --> 01:01:32,750
Now it turns out that
for N equals 365,

1164
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:36,840
the magic number for N
is 23, that by 23 people,

1165
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,180
we got a 50-50 chance.

1166
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:44,260
In fact, the probability of a
match on 23 people is 0.506.

1167
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:47,537
It's a little bit better
than 50-50 chance at 23.

1168
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,870
Now, maybe we should figure out.

1169
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:50,536
It's too late for
homework to figure out

1170
01:01:50,536 --> 01:01:53,340
what the chances are of going
this long without a match.

1171
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:55,910
That maybe worth
figuring that out.

1172
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:58,830
Now, it may seem
surprising at first

1173
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:01,530
that 23 people is
enough to have a 50/50

1174
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:06,000
chance because the chance of
any pair matching is 1 in 365,

1175
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,770
by our assumption.

1176
01:02:07,770 --> 01:02:12,330
And that's small, but there's
lots of pairs of people

1177
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:15,950
and every pair of people
have a chance to match

1178
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:20,420
and that's why 23 turns out
to be enough to get to 50-50.

1179
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:23,790
Now, we're going to do the
analysis for general M and N

1180
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:26,490
to the figure out the
probability of a match

1181
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:31,230
if there's M people
and N birthdays.

1182
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:32,990
There's lots of ways to do it.

1183
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:36,140


1184
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:41,220
The easiest is to sort of well,
we'll draw the sample space.

1185
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,110
It will be too big to
draw the whole thing,

1186
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:46,080
but we can sort of
model the sample space

1187
01:02:46,080 --> 01:02:47,538
and then look at
the sample points.

1188
01:02:47,538 --> 01:03:01,580


1189
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:08,710
So you've got the first person
and there's N birthdays here,

1190
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:14,630
so it could be anywhere from
January 1 out to December 31

1191
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:18,480
and in general this
will be N. And then you

1192
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:29,280
have the second person and
they have N possibilities

1193
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,510
for their birthday.

1194
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:38,400
And you take the tree down M
levels to the very last person

1195
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:38,900
here.

1196
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:45,920


1197
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,530
So each node has degree N and
there's M levels on this tree.

1198
01:03:50,530 --> 01:04:03,560
So the sample space is the set
of all n-tuples b1, b2, to bm,

1199
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:10,880
these are the birthdays
where every value of bi

1200
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:17,270
is between 1 and N. So a sample
point is all the birthdays

1201
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:18,925
of the M people.

1202
01:04:18,925 --> 01:04:22,180


1203
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,095
How many sample
points are there here?

1204
01:04:24,095 --> 01:04:28,460


1205
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:32,610
Remember how to
count these things?

1206
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:35,739
Number of leaves on an
N-ary tree of depth M or you

1207
01:04:35,739 --> 01:04:36,780
can think of it this way.

1208
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:41,950
I've got N choices for each
bi and there's M of them.

1209
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:42,884
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1210
01:04:42,884 --> 01:04:45,050
TOM LEIGHTON: So what's the
number of sample points?

1211
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:47,020
AUDIENCE: N to the M.

1212
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:54,720
TOM LEIGHTON: N to the M.
Because N choices here,

1213
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:57,820
N choices here, N
choices there, so you

1214
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:02,220
have N times N times N M times.

1215
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:07,160
And what's the probability
of each outcome?

1216
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:09,645
For a set of possible birthdays,
what's its probability?

1217
01:05:09,645 --> 01:05:13,460


1218
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:19,160
What's the probability
of b1, b2, bM?

1219
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:27,409


1220
01:05:27,409 --> 01:05:28,950
So the probability
of a sample point.

1221
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:31,491
What's the probability that the
first person has birthday b1,

1222
01:05:31,491 --> 01:05:36,810
the second has b2,
and the N-th has bM?

1223
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:37,546
Remember that?

1224
01:05:37,546 --> 01:05:38,046
Yeah.

1225
01:05:38,046 --> 01:05:39,330
AUDIENCE: 1 over N to the M.

1226
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:42,410
TOM LEIGHTON: 1 over N to
the M because each edge

1227
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:46,309
is probability of 1
over N and the paths

1228
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,600
are length M, so you've got
1 over N to the M-th power.

1229
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,770


1230
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:55,500
Probability of the first
birthday matching is 1 in N

1231
01:05:55,500 --> 01:06:01,420
times 1 in N times 1 in N.
And this actually makes sense

1232
01:06:01,420 --> 01:06:04,890
because I've got N to
the M sample points,

1233
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:08,000
each a probability
1 over N to the M.

1234
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,920
So they all add up
to 1, which is good.

1235
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,550
What kind of sample
space is this

1236
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:15,530
where this happens where all
the probabilities are the same?

1237
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:16,302
AUDIENCE: Uniform.

1238
01:06:16,302 --> 01:06:17,580
TOM LEIGHTON: Uniform.

1239
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,080
Makes it very easy to work with.

1240
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,240
All we got to do
now is just count

1241
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:22,940
the number of
sample points where

1242
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:27,130
there's a matching birthday and
then we multiply by that one

1243
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:30,830
probability 1 over N to the M.

1244
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:33,780
Now, it turns out that
rather than counting

1245
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:35,500
the number of sample
points where there's

1246
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,920
a matching birthday,
it's easier to count

1247
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:41,430
the number of sample points
for all the birthdays are

1248
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,095
different.

1249
01:06:43,095 --> 01:06:45,450
And this is often the case
when you're doing a counting

1250
01:06:45,450 --> 01:06:49,740
problem, it's easier
to count the opposite

1251
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:52,100
of what you're after.

1252
01:06:52,100 --> 01:06:54,420
That can be the case
and it is the case here.

1253
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,260
So we're going to do that.

1254
01:06:56,260 --> 01:06:59,680


1255
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:06,600
So let's count how many
sample points are all

1256
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:12,130
different birthdays, so no
pair of bi's is the same.

1257
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:13,180
Let's do that.

1258
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:15,724
How many choices
are there for b1?

1259
01:07:15,724 --> 01:07:20,480
365 or N. Let's do
this in terms of N

1260
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,400
because we're going to
use this for general N.

1261
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,470
How many choices for b2?

1262
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:26,360
N minus 1.

1263
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,950
Given you are the first
one, you can't match it.

1264
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:33,570
And then N minus 2 all the
way over to the last one

1265
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:37,360
is N minus M plus 1.

1266
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:41,050
And this is a formula
you should all remember.

1267
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:46,430
That's just N factorial
over N minus M factorial.

1268
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:49,300
You did this sort of stuff a
couple weeks ago with counting

1269
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:54,250
sets and probability is really--
a lot of it's about counting.

1270
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,280
So now we can compute
the probability

1271
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,990
that all the birthdays
are different.

1272
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:04,630


1273
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:08,660
It's just adding up all the
sample points of which there's

1274
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:14,080
n factorial over N minus
M factorial and multiply

1275
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:16,630
by the probability
of each one, which is

1276
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:22,430
1 over N to the M. All right.

1277
01:08:22,430 --> 01:08:24,630
So we've actually now
answered the question.

1278
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:28,670
This is the probability that
all the birthdays are different.

1279
01:08:28,670 --> 01:08:32,560
The only problem is,
it's not so clear

1280
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,720
what the answer is to
actually compute this

1281
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,250
or how fast it grows.

1282
01:08:37,250 --> 01:08:40,410
So if I wanted to get
a closed form for this

1283
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:42,979
without the factorials,
what do I do?

1284
01:08:42,979 --> 01:08:45,200
What do I use?

1285
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:48,310
Stirling's formula.

1286
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:49,460
So let's remember that.

1287
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:57,630


1288
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:01,870
It says that N factorial
is asymptotically equal

1289
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:09,830
to square root 2 pi N
times N over e to the N.

1290
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:15,529
And that is accurate within
0.1% when N is at least 100.

1291
01:09:15,529 --> 01:09:18,240
So not only is it
asymptotically equal,

1292
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:25,020
it's right on track for
a reasonable size N.

1293
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:27,899
Now, I won't drag you
through all the calculations.

1294
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:30,850
I used to actually try
plugging that formula

1295
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:33,024
in for here and
here and then going

1296
01:09:33,024 --> 01:09:35,440
through all the calculations,
but we won't do it in class.

1297
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,300
It's in the text.

1298
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:40,102
But I will tell you
where that winds up.

1299
01:09:40,102 --> 01:09:42,310
It's not hard, you've just
got to do the calculation.

1300
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:48,160


1301
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:51,430
So this is means the probability
that all birthdays are

1302
01:09:51,430 --> 01:10:04,830
different turns out to be
asymptotically equal to e

1303
01:10:04,830 --> 01:10:15,530
to the N minus M plus 1/2 times
the natural log of N over N

1304
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:23,670
minus M minus M. And that's
accurate to within 0.2%,

1305
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:25,950
if N and N minus M are
large, larger than 100.

1306
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:29,830
So in fact, it's almost equal.

1307
01:10:29,830 --> 01:10:36,650
And now you could plug in N
equals 365 and M equals 100.

1308
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:41,950
So if you do that, in fact,
if somebody has a calculator,

1309
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:45,950
we should plug in,
what do we have, 42.

1310
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,020
You should plug in
M equals 42 and see

1311
01:10:48,020 --> 01:10:50,300
what the probability is.

1312
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:56,330
But if M is 100, the chance
that we're all different,

1313
01:10:56,330 --> 01:11:05,150
this equals 3.07 dot, dot,
dot times 10 to the minus 7.

1314
01:11:05,150 --> 01:11:07,720
And we should check
for M equals 42.

1315
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:10,080
My guess is it's pretty
small, but I don't know.

1316
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,351
We'll have to check that.

1317
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:14,648
AUDIENCE: 0.0859.

1318
01:11:14,648 --> 01:11:15,540
TOM LEIGHTON: Great.

1319
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:22,190
So a 9% chance of having 42
people all miss is a 9% chance.

1320
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:23,480
So we were little unlucky.

1321
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,770
That won't happen very often.

1322
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:29,720
But when you go from 42 to
100, it gets really small.

1323
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:31,020
1 in 3 million or so.

1324
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:33,870


1325
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:39,840
Now, if N is 365 and M
is 23, the probability

1326
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,190
comes out to be about
0.49, so about 50-50,

1327
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:46,094
they're all different.

1328
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:50,540


1329
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:51,040
Now.

1330
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:54,210
For general M and
N, we'd like to know

1331
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:56,640
when do you get to
the 50-50 point?

1332
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,550
We'd like to derive an
equation for M in terms of N

1333
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:04,350
where the probability of being
all different is about 1/2.

1334
01:12:04,350 --> 01:12:04,850
All right.

1335
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:05,558
So let's do that.

1336
01:12:05,558 --> 01:12:16,270


1337
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:21,490
So as long as we assume--
and this will turn out

1338
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:24,830
to be true-- that M is a
little o of N to the 2/3

1339
01:12:24,830 --> 01:12:30,190
and remember little o means it
grows slower than N to the 2/3.

1340
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:32,230
Then we can simplify
that expression

1341
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:35,240
in asymptotic notation.

1342
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:40,405
And when you do it, I won't
drag it through on the board.

1343
01:12:40,405 --> 01:12:45,030
It's also in the text, it
turns out to be much simpler.

1344
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:49,900
It's just e to the
minus M squared over 2N.

1345
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:51,820
So I take that
thing up there and I

1346
01:12:51,820 --> 01:12:57,400
assume that M is growing less
fast than the 2/3 power of N

1347
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:59,500
and that whole upper
expression reduces down

1348
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,110
to M squared over 2N.

1349
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:04,310
Everything else goes
to 0 in the exponent.

1350
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:06,260
Doesn't matter.

1351
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:11,970
Now, if I set this
to be 1/2, I can

1352
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:17,610
solve this to find out what M
has to be to make that be 1/2.

1353
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:18,110
All right.

1354
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:24,710
So this will be true if and
only if minus M squared over 2N

1355
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:26,270
is equal to the
natural log of 1/2.

1356
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:29,610


1357
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,040
And that's true.

1358
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,820
Take the minus sign, put it
inside to make a log of 2,

1359
01:13:34,820 --> 01:13:36,580
multiply by 2N.

1360
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:43,590
That's true if M squared
equals 2N natural log of 2.

1361
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,800
And now I can solve
for M really easily.

1362
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:53,090
That's true if and
only if M equals

1363
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:58,360
the square root of 2
natural log of 2N, which

1364
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:08,560
is about 1.177 square root
of N. So for general N,

1365
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:14,020
you get a 50% probability of
having a matching birthday when

1366
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:21,920
M is in this range, pretty
close to 1.2 square root of N.

1367
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,024
Now, this square root N
phenomenon, this thing here,

1368
01:14:25,024 --> 01:14:26,940
that's what's known as
the birthday principle.

1369
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:29,630


1370
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:33,250
It says if you've got roughly
square root of N randomly

1371
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:39,580
allocated items into N
boxes or bins or birthdays,

1372
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:41,940
there's a decent
chance two of the items

1373
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:47,120
will go into the same bin
if the randomly allocated.

1374
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,130
In this case, the bins
are the possible days

1375
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:53,150
of the year that we put each
person into for their birthday.

1376
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:55,525
Any questions about that?

1377
01:14:55,525 --> 01:14:58,860


1378
01:14:58,860 --> 01:14:59,360
Yeah.

1379
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,328
AUDIENCE: M and N
are like numbers

1380
01:15:01,328 --> 01:15:03,460
like they're defined up
there or does it mean

1381
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:05,756
to say M equals [INAUDIBLE]?

1382
01:15:05,756 --> 01:15:06,980
TOM LEIGHTON: Yeah.

1383
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:10,370
So here I looked at a
special case where N was 365,

1384
01:15:10,370 --> 01:15:13,360
M was 100, but we
can imagine them

1385
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:17,350
as arbitrary numbers that
could be getting large.

1386
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:22,480
And so over here and I say M
is little o of N to the 2/3,

1387
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:26,250
I mean, well, M equals square
root of N would qualify.

1388
01:15:26,250 --> 01:15:29,950
Square root of N is
little o of N to the 2/3.

1389
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:33,320
So as long as M is
not growing too fast,

1390
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:36,950
I can simplify that expression
up there, which is what I did.

1391
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:40,890
And then we go back
and we find, in fact,

1392
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:42,980
the square root of
N the right answer

1393
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:45,650
and that is little
o of N to the 2/3.

1394
01:15:45,650 --> 01:15:48,400
And I have to use a
different argument

1395
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,750
if I assumed M was
bigger, which I didn't do.

1396
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:53,140
I didn't drag it for that.

1397
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:56,340
But I would have to
go check that case.

1398
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:58,320
So we can think of general
is M and N as being

1399
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,730
arbitrary variables and
potentially growing.

1400
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:03,710
M can be a function
of N. And in fact,

1401
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:06,170
when M is the square
root function of N, then

1402
01:16:06,170 --> 01:16:07,830
we got a 50% chance of a match.

1403
01:16:07,830 --> 01:16:11,080


1404
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:15,420
Now, the birthday
principle comes up all

1405
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:18,700
over the place in
computer science

1406
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:20,215
and it's worth remembering.

1407
01:16:20,215 --> 01:16:23,140


1408
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:26,286
For example, the
generic form for this

1409
01:16:26,286 --> 01:16:27,660
is when you have
a hash function.

1410
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:30,510


1411
01:16:30,510 --> 01:16:34,040
Let's say I have a
hash function, h,

1412
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:39,280
from a large set of items
into a small set of items.

1413
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:43,200
For example, say I'm
computing digital signatures.

1414
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,640
This is the space
of all messages,

1415
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:49,030
this is the space of all
1,000-bit digital signatures,

1416
01:16:49,030 --> 01:16:51,750
and h is a digital
signature outcome.

1417
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,720
Say I'm doing
memory allocations.

1418
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:57,190
So all the things I might
be sticking into a register,

1419
01:16:57,190 --> 01:16:58,640
here's all the
places it could go.

1420
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:00,360
Here's all the registers.

1421
01:17:00,360 --> 01:17:01,760
Error checking.

1422
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,490
This is all the garbled
messages in the world.

1423
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:07,360
This is the set of
messages that make sense,

1424
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:12,770
all handled by functions,
random kind of functions often.

1425
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:17,830
Now, what you worry about when
you're hashing is collisions.

1426
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:20,240
Let me define that.

1427
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:29,840
We say that x collides
with y if the hash of x

1428
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,710
equals the hash of y, but
x and y are different.

1429
01:17:33,710 --> 01:17:36,650


1430
01:17:36,650 --> 01:17:39,930
For example, say you're
looking at digital signatures.

1431
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:43,905
You would not want the
signature for a $100 check

1432
01:17:43,905 --> 01:17:49,692
to your mom to match your
signature for $100,000 check

1433
01:17:49,692 --> 01:17:50,430
to Boris.

1434
01:17:50,430 --> 01:17:52,717


1435
01:17:52,717 --> 01:17:54,550
Because that would be
bad because then Boris

1436
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:58,590
could come in and take that
check to your mom for $100,

1437
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:01,960
converted to a
$100,000 check to him

1438
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:04,370
and the signature is
authentic if there's

1439
01:18:04,370 --> 01:18:06,040
a collision in the signatures.

1440
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:08,200
So very important when
you're doing hash functions

1441
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:11,850
and in many applications,
you don't want collisions

1442
01:18:11,850 --> 01:18:14,160
because all the whole
thing start breaking.

1443
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:15,020
Memory allocation.

1444
01:18:15,020 --> 01:18:17,770
You don't want to assign two
things in the same place.

1445
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:18,880
Error correction.

1446
01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:23,100
There's only one answer you
want to get out at the end.

1447
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:24,810
Now, from the pigeon
hole principle,

1448
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:27,525
you know if this set is
bigger than that set,

1449
01:18:27,525 --> 01:18:28,900
there is going to
be a collision.

1450
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,720
That's what the pigeon
hole principle says.

1451
01:18:30,720 --> 01:18:33,490
Two guys will get mapped
to the same thing.

1452
01:18:33,490 --> 01:18:38,270
However, often in practice what
we care about is a subset L

1453
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:43,330
prime of L that's pretty small
because the set of messages we

1454
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:46,370
really assign is pretty small
compared to all 1,000-bit

1455
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:48,370
signatures that are possible.

1456
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:51,580
And what you'd like is that for
this smaller set of messages,

1457
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:56,210
you might want to assign, they
all get mapped one to one.

1458
01:18:56,210 --> 01:19:01,560
And the birthday principle
says life is not so nice.

1459
01:19:01,560 --> 01:19:04,391
So let me write that
down then we'll be done.

1460
01:19:04,391 --> 01:19:10,592


1461
01:19:10,592 --> 01:19:11,560
All right.

1462
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:29,870
So the birthday principle says
that if S is at least 100,

1463
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:36,590
L prime is a subset of L that is
at least the square root of S.

1464
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:39,740
So the cardinality of the
things you want to hash

1465
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:45,800
is bigger than 1.2 square
root the cardinality of S.

1466
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:57,290
And if the values of the
function h on L prime

1467
01:19:57,290 --> 01:20:14,260
are randomly chosen, uniform,
and mutually independent,

1468
01:20:14,260 --> 01:20:16,630
then there's at least
a 50% chance, so

1469
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:24,310
with probability at least
1/2, there's a collision.

1470
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:29,340
There exists an x and a y
such that x does not equal y--

1471
01:20:29,340 --> 01:20:37,621
and these are in L prime--
but h of x equals h of y.

1472
01:20:37,621 --> 01:20:38,120
All right.

1473
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:41,910
The proof is not hard, it's
just we more or less did it.

1474
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:44,880
You just plug in the
cardinality of L prime for M

1475
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,680
and the cardinality of S
for N. And it's bad news

1476
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:52,450
because it means it doesn't
take very many messages,

1477
01:20:52,450 --> 01:20:57,940
just square root the number of
signatures to get a collision.

1478
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:01,422
You'd hope you could get that
you could have L prime be

1479
01:21:01,422 --> 01:21:02,880
as big as S and
that somehow they'd

1480
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,637
all go one to one, that
everybody in this room

1481
01:21:05,637 --> 01:21:06,970
would have a different birthday.

1482
01:21:06,970 --> 01:21:09,380
That is not how it works
if things are random,

1483
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:11,750
which is the case you
usually like to have.

1484
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:16,000
Now, this technique is used to
crack cryptographic protocols

1485
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,720
and it's called the birthday
attack based on the birthday

1486
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:19,474
principle.

1487
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:20,890
So what you do is,
you get a bunch

1488
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:25,190
of messages that are
encrypted and pretty soon you

1489
01:21:25,190 --> 01:21:28,350
find two that get maybe
encrypted the same way.

1490
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:30,700
And once you have that,
now you can go back

1491
01:21:30,700 --> 01:21:33,640
and crack the crypto system.

1492
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,680
For example, you break schemes
like RSA with a birthday attack

1493
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:40,630
if this space is not
big enough and that's

1494
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:46,310
one reason why now RSA, the
keys have thousands of digits

1495
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:48,720
because otherwise you
can use attacks like this

1496
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:52,450
and crack them more easily.

1497
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:55,610
Any questions about that?

1498
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:56,110
OK.

1499
01:21:56,110 --> 01:21:56,610
Very good.

1500
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:58,710
We're done for today.

1501
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:01,352
