10
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,280
PROFESSOR: So let's get ready.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,000
If good, you should
receive some handouts.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,767
So the TAs are walking around,
so you should slowly get those.

13
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:38,600
This is the second
lecture on number theory,

14
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,990
and we're going to cover
for a lot of stuff.

15
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:42,510
And actually, we're
going to start

16
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:48,540
with encryption, which is an
application of number theory.

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,914
And we'll take that as a theme
throughout the whole lecture.

18
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:54,455
And so, in this way, you can
see how useful number theory is.

19
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:58,410


20
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,040
Now, encryption--
yeah, what is it?

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,680
So let's first talk
about it a little bit.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,820
Maybe some of you
have heard about it.

23
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,100
Cryptology in general is the
art of hiding information.

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,660
And encryption is
a very useful tool.

25
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:15,420
I'll only give a very
high level overview.

26
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,544
I mean, if you really want
to know more about this,

27
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:22,401
you should do a class in
crypto, or practical security.

28
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:23,275
So what's encryption?

29
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:29,520


30
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,970
The idea is usually
that, beforehand, we're

31
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:39,490
going to share a
whole bunch of keys.

32
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:47,370
So keys are exchanged between
a receiver and a sender.

33
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:51,140
And the whole idea is that
if I want to transmit, like,

34
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,380
a message to one
of you, well, there

35
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,820
could be someone
in the middle who

36
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,560
wants to intercept
my message, and wants

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,060
to find out what I'm saying.

38
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,690
So I do not like this.

39
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,560
And in order to avoid it,
I will use encryption,

40
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,600
which is some kind of algorithm
that actually transforms

41
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,790
my message m-- my plain
message-- by using

42
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,800
some kind of algorithm, E.
Some encryption algorithm--

43
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,760
it can be a function as
well-- that uses the keys

44
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,040
in order to transform this
into an encryption, which

45
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,850
we call m prime here.

46
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,370
So the plain text is, in the
clear, all the information

47
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,260
that I want to convey to
one of you, for example.

48
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:48,480
And m prime is somehow
a complete-- well,

49
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,190
a mixture of bits,
out of which I'm not

50
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,240
able to distill any information
about the plain text.

51
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,080
So encryption to a very
special kind of thing.

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,420
We're not going to talk about
the precise definitions here,

53
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,650
but we just take the
ID into this lecture.

54
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:10,810
Now, decryption is transforming
the cypher text back

55
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,830
into the plain text.

56
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:17,190
So we will start with
the encryption, m prime,

57
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,820
and we have some kind
of decryption algorithm.

58
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,050
And again, we can make use
of the keys we exchanged.

59
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,910
And we transform it back
into the plain message.

60
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,340
So only if I know the
keys, I can actually

61
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,060
transform back the encrypted
version into the plain version.

62
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,980
So in encryption schemes we
like both these algorithms

63
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,430
to be is really efficient.

64
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,680
And the security of such a
scheme-- well, the first kind

65
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,780
of intuition that
we can get is well,

66
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,800
if I'm a man in the
middle somewhere,

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,740
intercepting an encrypted
message-- m prime--

68
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,840
I should not be able to
get any information about m

69
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,400
if I have no knowledge
about those keys.

70
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,552
So this is the
example that we're

71
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:10,160
going to take throughout
this whole lecture.

72
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:17,440
So let's start with a
first possible scheme.

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:25,380
Turing, who lived around
1936-- he was 24 years old--

74
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,760
and he lived to
about-- actually,

75
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,780
I think he was about
54 when he died.

76
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,600
In any case, Turing was the one
who first originally proposed

77
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,350
to use number theory
in cryptography.

78
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:44,280
And before he joined the British
army, before the Second World

79
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,270
War, he actually
proposed a scheme,

80
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,700
but it got never published.

81
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,480
So here in this
class, we are going

82
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,000
to try to think about what
he could have thought about.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,540
So we will have a
first scheme, which

84
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,510
we will call Turing's
code, version number one.

85
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,490
And the whole idea
is that we're going

86
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,520
to translate a message first
of all into a prime number,

87
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,430
because we want to use numbers.

88
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,930
We're here in
number theory class,

89
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,230
so we want to use some
tricks with numbers in order

90
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,810
to encrypt it.

91
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:19,800
So let's do this.

92
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,620


93
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,780
So for example, let's
take the word victory.

94
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,460


95
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,270
We can map this into an integer.

96
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,850
For example, we could
say, well, m is 22,

97
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,250
where I map V to--
because I know

98
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:46,600
V is the 22nd letter in the
alphabet, I just start with 22.

99
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,890
I is the ninth letter in the
alphabet, so I append 09.

100
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,470
C is the third letter in the
alphabet, I append 3-- 03.

101
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,820
I continue like this
and in end, over here

102
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,240
I've mapped Y to
the 25th letter.

103
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,820
Because it's the 25th letter
of alphabet, I write 25.

104
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,520
It turns out, I can just
add a couple of digits

105
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,030
more, if I specially
compute those.

106
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:18,630
In this case, I could
add 13, and then it

107
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,250
changes into a prime number.

108
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,990


109
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,000
Now we are not going to
talk about why this is,

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,810
and how this can
be done, and so on.

111
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:31,350
But it turns out that the
prime numbers are densely

112
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,090
distributed over the integers,
and it's really possible to,

113
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,110
just with a few extra
digits-- by selecting them

114
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:41,820
in a smart way-- to actually
create a prime number.

115
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,100
And also verify that it is a
prime number very efficiently.

116
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:49,880
So it's very easy to compute--
to translate such a word

117
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,490
into a prime number.

118
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,600
So this is how it all starts.

119
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,950
And just like in an
encryption scheme,

120
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:04,490
beforehand we are going
to exchange a key.

121
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:13,730
So we exchange the secret
prime in this example,

122
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,790
which we call k.

123
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,030
And the encryption
is very simple.

124
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,210
We are just going to
multiply m with k.

125
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:27,050
Now, you may wonder why this
is such a fantastic idea.

126
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,750
But let's just bear with me.

127
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,970
So m is this first prime
number, and we multiply it

128
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,480
by a second prime
number, and that's

129
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,810
going to be our encryption.

130
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,132
Now how do we decrypt?

131
00:07:40,132 --> 00:07:42,090
That seems to be pretty
straightforward, right?

132
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,560
How do we do it?

133
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,350
We start off with m prime.

134
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:50,490
I know we have exchanged
this secret prime k,

135
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:54,110
so if I receive from
you this message--

136
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:57,050
this encrypted message--
well, I know the key, k.

137
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,820
So I just divide it by k.

138
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:05,030
Well, which is m k
divided k, and I get m.

139
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:07,730
So that's pretty
straightforward.

140
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,880
Now, as it turns out actually--
and I'll write it up here,

141
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,900
because we need it later-- that
it's not so trivial to actually

142
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:23,020
just give an m prime to
figure out what m is, or k.

143
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,450
m prime is a product of two
very large prime numbers,

144
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,996
and that turns out to be
a really hard problem.

145
00:08:28,996 --> 00:08:30,370
Up to now, nobody
has really been

146
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,159
able to get a really efficient
algorithm to solve that.

147
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,610
So we may think this is secure.

148
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:45,630
So let me write it down
It's hard to factor

149
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,460
a product of two large primes.

150
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:57,850


151
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,830
You will actually
need this also,

152
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,970
when we come to the final
encryption scheme-- RSA

153
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,580
that we will discuss,
which is widely used.

154
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:13,241


155
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:14,740
But something is
wrong here, though.

156
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,510
This seems to be
too simple, right?

157
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,040
So what can we do if
we have like, say,

158
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,970
suppose I intercept
two encrypted messages.

159
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:23,680
What can I do?

160
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:31,800


161
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,900
So suppose I have
a first message, m

162
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,920
prime 1, which is the product
of a first plain message

163
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,800
times the key, k.

164
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,490
And I have a second
message that is

165
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,480
encrypted by using the same
key, which is m 2 times k.

166
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,730
Does anybody have an idea
what I could do here?

167
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,400
AUDIENCE: Find the GCD and
that would give you the key.

168
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,680
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you
could find the GCD

169
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,000
of m 1 prime and m 2 prime.

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,720
I've intercepted those two.

171
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,220
Now, m 1 is a prime number.

172
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,160
k is prime number, and
2 is a prime number.

173
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,970
k is a prime number
here, also, right?

174
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:16,690
So they're all relatively
prime towards one another.

175
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:23,080
The GCD of these two-- well, the
greatest common divisor is k.

176
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,390
So just by calculating the GCD
of the two encrypted messages,

177
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,070
I'll be able to figure
out what k is-- the key.

178
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,800
Well, if I know
the key, then I can

179
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,440
do the decryption
of any cypher text,

180
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,360
any encryption of a message
that I can intercept.

181
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,730
So this is not secure.

182
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:47,030
So how can we change this?

183
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:53,870
Can we create a different
kind of encryption scheme?

184
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,710
Let's do something
much more difficult,

185
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:01,550
and then we will get into
modular arithmetic and things

186
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,387
like that.

187
00:11:02,387 --> 00:11:03,095
So let's do this.

188
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:08,290


189
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,950
So Turing's code,
version number two--

190
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,420
we try to do something much
more complicated than just

191
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,050
multiplying by prime.

192
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,230
So let's do the following.

193
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:27,270
So beforehand, we're
going to exchange not only

194
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:33,890
a secret prime k, but we will
also exchange a public prime.

195
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:39,430
So we exchange-- by public
we mean that anybody

196
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,630
can see this prime.

197
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,790
It's common knowledge.

198
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:54,240
A public prime p, and
also a secret prime k.

199
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,780
Let's see whether
this would work.

200
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,595
We have encryption.

201
00:11:58,595 --> 00:12:01,490


202
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:04,680
Well, we're going to start
out exactly the same way.

203
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,870


204
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,450
First of all, I should tell you
how a message is represented.

205
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:19,360
The message is going to be
represented as a number, m,

206
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:25,270
in the range from 0, 1,
all the way to p minus 1.

207
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:31,988
And we will compute the
encryption as follows.

208
00:12:31,988 --> 00:12:38,970
m is going to be the
remainder of m times k,

209
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:42,930
after dividing out as many
multiples of p as possible.

210
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:45,560
So notice we do kind
of the same thing.

211
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,830
We just multiply
by k, but now we

212
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,730
just take the remainder
after taking out

213
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,080
as many multiples of p.

214
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,650
Well, let's see whether
we can do the decryption.

215
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,950
It seems to be, like, a
next level of complexity.

216
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,900
So maybe that'll
help us here, right?

217
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,750
So how will we do decryption?

218
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,630
Well, somehow we would
like to divide by k.

219
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,940
But we cannot really
do that, right?

220
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:15,570
This does not make any sense.

221
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,990
So the decryption-- we
have no idea at this point

222
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,410
how to do this.

223
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,070
And now we can get into
modular arithmetic,

224
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:26,220
because it turns out that
we can sort of divide by k.

225
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,790
There exists what we call
multiplicative inverse

226
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,720
of k modulo p.

227
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,580
And I will explain all
those terminologies to you.

228
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,260
And then we will be
able to take m prime,

229
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,320
and transform it back to m.

230
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,160
So we will be able to get a
lot of this machinery going.

231
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,250
So let's find out
how this works.

232
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:58,510
So first of all, last time we
saw that we defined a and b

233
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,870
to be relatively prime.

234
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,030
So let me repeat that.

235
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:07,400
So a and b are relatively
prime if and only

236
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:13,190
if-- that's how we define
it-- if the GCD of a and b

237
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:13,810
is equal to 1.

238
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:17,610
And in last lecture
and in the recitation,

239
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,860
you got a different
proof, I think.

240
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:25,300
And we proved that,
actually, the GCD of a and b

241
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:28,560
is equal to the smallest
positive linear combination

242
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,780
of a and b.

243
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,880
So that means that
one, in particular,

244
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,500
is a linear
combination of a and b.

245
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,010
So there exists
integers-- s and t--

246
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:44,041
such that s times a,
plus t times b equals 1.

247
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:46,290
It turns out that it can
also go the other way around,

248
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:51,930
because if I can write one as
a linear combination of a b,

249
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,060
well I cannot get much
lower than that, right?

250
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,730
So that's really the smallest
possible that I can achieve.

251
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,080
So the GCD must be equal to 1.

252
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,940
So this is a property
that we will be using.

253
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,130


254
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:09,910
And from this property,
we can already figure out

255
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,940
an interesting property.

256
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,500
So suppose we have a
linear combination that

257
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,100
looks like this.

258
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,720
Then you can imagine
that, sort of,

259
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,260
that s times a is equal
to 1, plus or minus

260
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,300
some linear multiple of b.

261
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,200
So it's sort of-- s times
a is sort of equal to 1,

262
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,480
you can say, up to
a multiple of b.

263
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,000
So you can see a sort
of as an inverse of s.

264
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,380
Because s times a is
equal to one, sort of.

265
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,660
So this is what we're going
to use-- this kind of feeling.

266
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,745
And in order to do that, we
are going to define congruency.

267
00:15:50,745 --> 00:15:55,230


268
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,300
So that's the first
definition for this lecture.

269
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:10,940
We say x is congruent
to y modulo n,

270
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:18,160
if-- which we denote as
follows-- x with three bars,

271
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,460
y in between brackets, mod n.

272
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:31,330
And we say that this is
the case if n divides

273
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,150
the difference between x and y.

274
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,845
So let's have a look
at some examples.

275
00:16:36,845 --> 00:16:44,580


276
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,130
So let's take 31,
and I would like

277
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:53,250
to show to you that
this is congruent to 16

278
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:57,570
modulo, between brackets, 5.

279
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,550
Why is this?

280
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:02,910
Well, I take the difference
between 31 and 16, which is 15,

281
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:08,700
and I know that 15 is 3 times
5, so 5 divides this difference.

282
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,210
And then by definition,
we can write it like this.

283
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,390
And we say-- that's
the definition--

284
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,730
31 is congruent to 16 modulo 5.

285
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:24,290
Another example is-- no, we
will stick with this example.

286
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,569
It's pretty clear.

287
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:31,920
So once we have defined this,
we can continue and talk

288
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,310
about this inverse that
I was talking about.

289
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:39,020
So we like to, sort of, explain
in this encryption scheme

290
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,540
how we can divide by k.

291
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:46,310
Actually, we would like to
multiply by an inverse of k.

292
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,420
And we're going to
use this framework.

293
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,140
So we'll have a
new definition that

294
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,950
talks about the
multiplicative inverse.

295
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,180
So it's a new concept.

296
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,780
And you'll give a
couple of examples.

297
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:15,350
So the multiplicative
inverse of x modulo n

298
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:24,240
is a number, which we
denote by x and then minus 1

299
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,290
on top of here.

300
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:34,960
It's a number in the interval 0,
1, all the way up to n minus 1.

301
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,800
Such that x times
x inverse-- so x

302
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,190
times its
multiplicative inverse--

303
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,440
is congruent to 1 modulo n.

304
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,810
So this is the definition
for a multiplicative inverse.

305
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,180
So let's have some examples.

306
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:00,440


307
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,890
So let's do that over here.

308
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:10,690
For example, we have that 2
times 3-- which equals 6--

309
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:15,900
is equal to 1 modulo 5.

310
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,680
Why is this?

311
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,310
Well, 6 minus 1
is divisible by 5,

312
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:24,720
so I know is congruent
to 1 modulo 5.

313
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,130
So what does this mean?

314
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,160
Well, we can say
that two is actually

315
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:36,460
equal to the multiplicative
inverse of 3 modulo 5.

316
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:42,060
We can also say that write 3
is the multiplicative inverse

317
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:45,450
of 2 modulo 5.

318
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,800
Let's have another example, just
to make it a little bit more

319
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,150
clear.

320
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,370
We know that 5
times 5 equals 25,

321
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,370
and this is
congruent to 1 modulo

322
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:03,150
6, because 25 is
1 plus 4 times 6.

323
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:05,040
So now we see something
funny happening,

324
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:11,030
because 5 is actually equal to
its own multiplicative inverse

325
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,720
modulo 6.

326
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:18,470


327
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,310
So are there any questions
about these concepts?

328
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,630
Because these are really
basic for the whole lecture,

329
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,073
and this is what you really
need to understand if you do

330
00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:29,990
all the problem sets as well.

331
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:32,160
Are there any questions?

332
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,910
So now we can
actually start talking

333
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:44,670
about this second version of the
Turing code that we invented.

334
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,450
Let's have a look
at this remainder.

335
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,430
So let's write it out again.

336
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:53,750
The remainder of m times
k, after dividing out

337
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,230
as many multiples of p.

338
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:02,030
Well, we know that this is
congruent to m times k modulo

339
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,990
p.

340
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,020
So why is this?

341
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,562
Well, we just apply the
definition over here.

342
00:21:08,562 --> 00:21:10,270
We take the difference
between those two.

343
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,810
So here we have the
remainder of m times k,

344
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:18,930
after dividing out as
many multiples of p.

345
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:22,470
And if you subtract
that from m times k,

346
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,350
well then we have something
that is a multiple of p,

347
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,560
because that's what
we divided out.

348
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,570
So the difference
is a multiple of p,

349
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:34,810
so that means that p
divides the difference.

350
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,950
And that's the definition of
saying that this remainder is

351
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,540
congruent m k modulo p.

352
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:44,750
So this is kind of
interesting, because now we

353
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:48,570
can rewrite over there--
well, not really rewrite,

354
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:53,240
but we can use this to analyze
the encryption over here.

355
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,640
So m prime is equal
to this remainder.

356
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,070
And we get a
beautifully equation.

357
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,260
We see that the encryption is
congruent to the plain message,

358
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,930
times the key modulo p.

359
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,140
So how do I do decryption?

360
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:12,330
I can use the multiplicative
inverse of k, right?

361
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,510
So then I can divide k out.

362
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:18,770


363
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,640
So let's write this out as well.

364
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,410
So suppose I have a
multiplicative inverse--

365
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:33,230
k to the power minus 1-- that
is congruent to 1 modulo p.

366
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,710
Why do I do this?

367
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,870
Why am I writing this out?

368
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,950
Because you will see
that it is not always

369
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,840
possible to have a
multiplicative inverse.

370
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,170
That's going to be
really a big problem.

371
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:50,380
And that's where all
these other functions

372
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,330
come in-- the Euler totient
function and Euler's theorem,

373
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,020
and so on.

374
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,910
So it's not really
always the case.

375
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:58,410
We'll give an
example in a moment.

376
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,610
But suppose that we have a
multiplicative inverse-- modulo

377
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:08,130
p-- well, then I'm
able to easily compute.

378
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:13,810
I take m prime, I multiply
it with k inverse.

379
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:21,630
Well, I'm substituting for
m prime, m times k-- times

380
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,600
k inverse.

381
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,500
I still have this left.

382
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:29,690
Now I can say that this
is equal to 1 modulo p.

383
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:32,220


384
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:39,030
So this is equal, or is
congruent, to m modulo p.

385
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,440
So now we see how we
can do decryption.

386
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,090
We simply use the
multiplicative inverse of k.

387
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,700
And as in the first
Turing code, we

388
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,710
are able to somehow
divide out-- so where

389
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,346
did I have it-- to divide out k.

390
00:23:54,346 --> 00:23:56,470
I did it very differently--
I have a very different

391
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:01,090
mathematical structure-- but the
idea is, essentially, the same.

392
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:04,720
I have a multiplicative
inverse of k,

393
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,710
and if I multiply this
with the encryption,

394
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,920
I will get the plain
message, modulo p.

395
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:13,660
So, am I finished
now is the question.

396
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:21,150
Well, I know that m is in the
range of 0, 1, all the way up

397
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,480
to p minus 1.

398
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,150
So this means that I
can also rewrite m as--

399
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:32,300
and I use a similar trick
as what I did over here--

400
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:39,090
I can rewrite m as they
remainder of m prime times k

401
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:45,210
inverse, after dividing out as
many copies of p as possible.

402
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,590
So what we did here
is to first prove

403
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:53,290
that the difference between
those two is a multiple of p.

404
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:56,730
That's essentially
what congruent modulo p

405
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,350
means-- that's the definition.

406
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:02,890
So now that I know that the
difference is a multiple of p,

407
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:09,350
and if I know that m is actually
in this range up to p minus 1,

408
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,460
I can use what we
learned last lecture--

409
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:16,230
and what the book was talking
about-- that the definition

410
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,400
of the remainder of m prime
times k inverse-- this thing--

411
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,350
after finding out
as many copies of p,

412
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,440
is exactly this plain message m.

413
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,234
OK, so now we the decryption.

414
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,150
So this is decryption.

415
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,870


416
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:35,040
And that sounds great.

417
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,520
So now, of course, we
are wondering, well,

418
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,170
if we can do this, can we also
attack this scheme, right?

419
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:46,920
Can we do something bad with it?

420
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,380
Well, it can be used
to break this code,

421
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,730
but in a slightly
more complicated way.

422
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,700


423
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,750
So let's see where I put that.

424
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:04,290
Right, so what we are
going to use, now-- so when

425
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:06,700
we talk about
security, and so on,

426
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,560
you can think of
all kinds of ways

427
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,940
to break an encryption scheme.

428
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,620
So we started out with,
in the first version,

429
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,140
well, what if I just
know the encryption?

430
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:21,940
And then, well, I cannot know
anything about the plain text,

431
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,720
simply because I know that it's
very hard to factor a product

432
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,080
of two large primes.

433
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,920
Then I said, but suppose
I know a little bit more

434
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,660
as an adversary.

435
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,580
Suppose I have a
plain message together

436
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,430
with an encrypted message.

437
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,600
Well, then I could
do this GCD trick

438
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,000
and figure out and
break the scheme.

439
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,310
And now we're going to
do something similar.

440
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:52,290
And we say, well, suppose that
I do not know two encryptions,

441
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,470
but I know a plain message.

442
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,000
And in corresponding,
encrypted message.

443
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,170
So if I know such a pair,
which is-- I mean, in practice,

444
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,220
such type of information
will be leaked.

445
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,740
Then in this case,
I can break it.

446
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,700
So we call this the known
the plain text attack.

447
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:21,760
And it assumes that we
know-- as an adversary,

448
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:31,010
I know a message-- a plain
message, m-- and also

449
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:40,330
an encryption of this
message, m prime.

450
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,300
And m prime, according
to this scheme,

451
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,590
is the remainder of m times
k, after the dividing out

452
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:51,480
as many multiples
of p as possible.

453
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,330
Now, we saw-- now,
suppose I know these two.

454
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,550
I'm going to show
you how to break it.

455
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,750
So let's have a look.

456
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:04,860
The encryption, m prime, is
congruent to m times k modulo

457
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,160
p.

458
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,100
We just proved it over here.

459
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,740
And what do we know?

460
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,400
We know that p is
a public prime.

461
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,590
I know p.

462
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:24,290
Since it's a prime, I know that
the GCD of m and p equals 1.

463
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,630
So these two are
relatively prime.

464
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:29,500
So now if they are
relatively prime--

465
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,620
and that's what
we wrote up here--

466
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,080
we know that there exists
this linear combination

467
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:43,310
of, in this case, m and
p that is equal to 1.

468
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,740
And this way we
can figure out how

469
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:51,590
to compute the inverse-- the
multiplicative inverse of m.

470
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,020
So that's what
we're going to do.

471
00:28:54,020 --> 00:29:01,870
So we can compute and the
multiplicative inverse, such

472
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:09,250
that m times m inverse is
congruent to 1 modulo p.

473
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,040


474
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,190
So now we can do the next step.

475
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,780
So what could I do next?

476
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,890
So let's see, if I
have such an inverse,

477
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,530
then I can take my
encrypted message

478
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:30,330
that I have as an
attacker, which is m prime.

479
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,310
I know m, and
since p was public,

480
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:36,150
I can compute this
multiplicative inverse.

481
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,370
So I could just
compute this product,

482
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:46,350
and I know that this is actually
equal to, well, k times m times

483
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,580
m inverse.

484
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,370
This is again equal to--
congruent to 1 modulo p.

485
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:55,700
So this is equal to k modulo p.

486
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,080
So now, all of a sudden,
I know k modulo p,

487
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,060
because I know those two.

488
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:06,990
So if I know k, I can compute
its multiplicative inverse.

489
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:13,230
So I can compute k
inverse modulo p.

490
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:15,930
And if I know k
inverse, again, I

491
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:20,690
can use it to decrypt any
other encrypted message

492
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,290
that I receive.

493
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:25,220
So for all future
encrypted messages,

494
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:28,460
I do not need anymore
the plain messages.

495
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,990
I've already used-- just
by using one plain message

496
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:37,280
encryption pair, I have been
able to compute the secret key,

497
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,990
and the whole scheme is broken.

498
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:46,890
So security is kind of
an interesting science.

499
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,040
We can always think
of more tricks

500
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,480
to break schemes, or
other assumptions,

501
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,070
that we haven't
thought about before.

502
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:02,120
And so now, let's talk about--
so what did we do here?

503
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,750


504
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:10,900
We have been talking about
encryption-- these two schemes.

505
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,050
We talked about
modular arithmetic.

506
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,060
We talked about
congruence, and also

507
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,060
the multiplicative inverse.

508
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:22,490
And we showed how to use that
to break Turing's code, version

509
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,080
number two.

510
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,910
So we need something
much more fundamental

511
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:30,300
in order to create a scheme
that is really secure.

512
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,070
And that's what we're
going to do now.

513
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,820
We're going to start off with
Euler's totient function,

514
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,780
and improve a related theorem.

515
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:43,070
And with that we will be
able to actually explain

516
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:46,490
RSA algorithm, which is a
famous algorithm invented here

517
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:52,760
at MIT in 1977, by Rivest,
Shamir, and Adleman.

518
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,820
And they actually also
got the Turing Award

519
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,600
for this a few years ago.

520
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:03,200
And it's widely
used in practice.

521
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,070
But we will be able
to actually explain

522
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,770
this algorithm with just this
fundamental piece of number

523
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,490
theory.

524
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:10,962
So that's really exciting.

525
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:11,670
So let's do this.

526
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:16,390


527
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:20,425
So we're going to first define
Euler's totient function.

528
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:31,290


529
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,580
And it's related to this
multiplicative inverse.

530
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:48,510


531
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:52,890
This function is
denoted phi of n,

532
00:32:52,890 --> 00:33:10,350
and it denote the
number of the integers

533
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:16,460
in 1, 2, 3-- all the way
up to n minus 1, that

534
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:29,400
are relatively prime to n.

535
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:35,280
So this just drops out of
the air, you may think.

536
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,830
But this is a
fundamental quantity,

537
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:43,830
and Euler's theorem is what
we will try to prove next.

538
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,750
But let's give a
couple of examples

539
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:50,350
about this, just to
see how it works.

540
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,430


541
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:58,070
So for example, let's
take n to be equal to 12.

542
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:02,270
What would be the value of
Euler's totient function,

543
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:05,150
evaluated for 12?

544
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:15,010
So if you take 12, we have the
following numbers to consider.

545
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:23,480
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10,11, and 12.

546
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,900
So now, let's have a look.

547
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:27,996


548
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:29,729
You want to count
the integers that

549
00:34:29,729 --> 00:34:31,850
are relatively prime to 12.

550
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:34,429


551
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,230
Well, 1 is relatively
prime to 12.

552
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,179
Why is that?

553
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:42,570
Because to GCD of 12
and 1 is equal to 1,

554
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,770
and that's the definition
of being relatively prime.

555
00:34:44,770 --> 00:34:47,510
So this is a good number.

556
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:52,730
The GCD of 12 and 2, well
both are divisible by 2.

557
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,685
So they're not relatively
prime, because the GCD

558
00:34:55,685 --> 00:34:56,909
is at least two.

559
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,120
In this case, equal to 2.

560
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,388
3 also divides 12.

561
00:35:01,388 --> 00:35:03,410
4 divides 12.

562
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:07,020
5 is relatively prime
with respect to 12.

563
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:11,500
6 actually is
dividing 12 as well.

564
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,680
7 is relatively prime,
and 11 over here as well.

565
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,510
And all the others have
a greatest common divisor

566
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:21,390
that's larger than 1.

567
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:26,010
So here we see that the Euler's
totient function evaluated

568
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,100
in 12 is equal to 4.

569
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:31,720
There are one, two,
three, four integers

570
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,250
that are relatively prime.

571
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:36,800
OK, so let's have
a different one.

572
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,200
Say, n equals 15.

573
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,040
It's little bit different,
because here you

574
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,013
may think this is kind
of coincidental that 1,

575
00:35:45,013 --> 00:35:48,870
5, 7, and 11 are
actually, also, primes.

576
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:50,780
But for 15 it looks a
little bit different.

577
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,300


578
00:35:55,300 --> 00:36:01,150
So let's write out
all the numbers.

579
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,590
Again, let's have a look.

580
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,750
Well, one is the
greatest common divisor

581
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:08,290
equal to 1, with respect to 15.

582
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:13,240
2 is also relatively
prime, with respect to 15.

583
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,416
3 is dividing 15.

584
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:20,200
4-- yeah, 4 and 15 have greatest
common divisor equal to 1.

585
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,400
So that's relatively prime.

586
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,200
5 is not.

587
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,930
6 is not.

588
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:27,540
7 is relatively prime.

589
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:31,260
8-- again, this is only
divisible by power of 2,

590
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:35,780
and this has no
power of 2 in it.

591
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:41,750
9, 10 are-- this one is
divisible by 5, divisible by 3.

592
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:44,520
11 is, again, relatively prime.

593
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,100
And then we have 13 is
relatively prime as well.

594
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,460
And 14 as well, because
this is 2 times 7,

595
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,240
and this is 3 times 5.

596
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,880
So how many do we see now?

597
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,722
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

598
00:36:57,722 --> 00:37:01,660


599
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,570
So the Euler's totient
function evaluated in 15

600
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,540
is actually equal to 8.

601
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:10,240
Now, it turns out
that this function has

602
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,560
really nice properties,
and you can easily

603
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,610
calculate-- if you know
the decomposition of n

604
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:21,340
into its primes, and
powers of primes--

605
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:28,190
you can easily compute
this number, phi of n.

606
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,300
Now, you will be able to
find this in the book.

607
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,160
You should read it.

608
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,340
And also, problem
set talks about this.

609
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,820
But for now, let's
just talk about this

610
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,950
is an abstract notion,
because that's all

611
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:43,370
that we will use
in this lecture.

612
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,940
But you will have
a few exercises

613
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:48,170
to talk about computing
this kind of stuff.

614
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:58,410
OK, so let's talk about Euler's
totient function and Euler's

615
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,140
theorem.

616
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:04,325
So let me use this blackboard.

617
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:14,260


618
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,800
Now, this is really
an exciting theorem.

619
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,110
And it's a little
bit hard to prove.

620
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:24,810
So why we'll need a little
bit more time to do this.

621
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:27,430
Euler's theorem
says the following.

622
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:34,750
If the GCD of n and
k is equal to 1,

623
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:42,520
then k to the power [INAUDIBLE]
the Euler's totient function

624
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:50,280
evaluated in n is actually
congruent to 1 modulo n.

625
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,340
So this is what we're
going to prove here.

626
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,920
So why is this so interesting?

627
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,760
Well, we'll talk about
an application which

628
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,160
is a direct consequence of
this theorem, which we'll

629
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,550
call Fermat's little theorem.

630
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:07,430
And that, in turn, we will use
to explain the RSA algorithm,

631
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:11,480
and show how the decryption
works, and so on.

632
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,000
So how can we prove this?

633
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:21,450


634
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:37,570
It will start with
a first lemma,

635
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:41,310
and then we're going to do a few
tricks-- mathematical tricks,

636
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,510
you will see it.

637
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:48,960
So the first lemma
is that if I know

638
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,120
that the GCD-- which is
what we are assuming,

639
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:55,646
the statement of the theorum--
if I know that the GCD of n

640
00:39:55,646 --> 00:40:04,480
and k equals 1, then I
know that and a times k--

641
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:12,720
if a times k is congruent
to b times k modulo n,

642
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,890
then this applies that a
is congruent to b modulo n.

643
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:21,435
All this seems to be kind
of a straightforward lemma.

644
00:40:21,435 --> 00:40:24,180
I will only talk
about its proof.

645
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,550
So how do we do it?

646
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:29,790
Well, first of all, I know that
the GCD of n and k equals 1.

647
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:36,440
So that means that I can create
a multiplicative inverse,

648
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,970
because I know that there's
such a linear combination that

649
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:46,240
will ends up to 1.

650
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,140
So I have the
multiplicative inverse.

651
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:55,330
I multiply both sides with
this, and then I will end up to,

652
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,230
a is congruent to b modulo n.

653
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:59,300
And actually, you can
use some of the facts

654
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,670
on your sheet to prove this.

655
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,280
And in the problem
set, you probably

656
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,020
have seen that there
are a number of problems

657
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,875
related to this.

658
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:13,080


659
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,610
So you will recognize this,
and prove a few of these things

660
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,410
yourself.

661
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:24,570
OK, so this is-- so let me see.

662
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:29,380


663
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,960
So let me see what
we have done here.

664
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,610


665
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,680
Actually, I noticed that
I've missed one statement

666
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,600
that I would like to
explicitly mention.

667
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,510
I mean, I've used
it a few times.

668
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:45,740
Let me do that first.

669
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:56,740
Which is that, we know that if
the GCD of n and k equals 1,

670
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:02,460
then-- this is if, and
only if, the case-- if k

671
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:09,780
has a multiplicative inverse--
I've not yet explicitly stated

672
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:16,400
it-- and we can
easily see this--

673
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,000
let me just give a quick
proof to show how this works.

674
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,960


675
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:31,050
Well, if the GCD is
equal to 1, then we

676
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:34,090
use the statement up there.

677
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:37,530
So this is if,
and only if, there

678
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,470
exists a linear combination.

679
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:46,250
So an s and a t, such that
n times s plus k times t

680
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,170
equals 1.

681
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:56,450
Well, then I also know that
there exists a t such that,

682
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:01,280
actually, the difference
between 1 and k times t

683
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,740
is divisible by n.

684
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:10,716
So n divides the difference
of k times t minus 1.

685
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:12,080
So why is that?

686
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,570
Well, if I look at the
difference between k times

687
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:17,580
t and 1, the difference
is n times s.

688
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,640
And n times s is divisible by n.

689
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,480
So now, by the
definition of congruence,

690
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,710
I just apply the
definition over here.

691
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,390
We have written it out here.

692
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:37,470
We can say that k times t
is congruent to 1 modulo n.

693
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:41,970
And this is the definition of
the multiplication inverse.

694
00:43:41,970 --> 00:43:46,000
So we have essentially
shown that if the greatest

695
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,650
common divisors in
any case equal to 1,

696
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:52,380
then it has a
multiplicative inverse.

697
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:58,300
OK, we have been using
this property over

698
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:02,990
here because we assume that
the greatest common divisor is

699
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:03,860
equal to 1.

700
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:08,720
So we now know that there exists
a multiplicative inverse of k.

701
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,440
We use that one to
multiply away, essentially,

702
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,870
the k out of this
equation, and get

703
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:19,320
a is congruent to b modulo n.

704
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:24,160
Also note that we use
the property over here.

705
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:32,520
We said that we wanted to
compute, what was it again?

706
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,480
Over here-- we started off
with the GCD of m and p

707
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,280
to be equal to 1, and I know p.

708
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,920
And now I can compute the
multiplicative inverse of m.

709
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,930
And I should have
said why it exists.

710
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,950
And it exists
because of that lemma

711
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:53,140
that I just mentioned up here.

712
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,395
OK, so now let's go
back to Euler's theorem.

713
00:44:55,395 --> 00:44:58,030


714
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:01,070
This first lemma we are going
to use to prove a second lemma,

715
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:03,030
and that second
lemma we can finally

716
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:04,850
use to prove the theorem.

717
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:07,610


718
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:15,570
All right, so this lemma I
will put on a separate board,

719
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,205
because it contains quite
a number of steps to prove.

720
00:45:18,205 --> 00:45:26,400


721
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:38,430
So the lemma states that, if we
suppose that the GCD of n and k

722
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:44,090
equals 1-- so it's the same
assumptions as before-- if it

723
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:53,580
lets k1 all the way up to k r to
be those integers in the range

724
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:59,970
1, 2, 3, and so
on, to n minus 1,

725
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:05,000
that are relatively
prime-- so these denote

726
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:15,640
the integers relatively
prime to n-- then

727
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:18,555
we can prove a very
interesting property.

728
00:46:18,555 --> 00:46:21,270


729
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:24,690
Now, notice by the
way, that r in here

730
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:28,780
is equal to this value of
the Euler's totient function

731
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,380
evaluated in n.

732
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,080
Because this counts
the total number

733
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:40,390
of numbers that are relatively
prime with respect to n.

734
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:44,200
So now we can prove
something really spectacular.

735
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,830
We can show that the
set that contains

736
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:54,350
all of these remainders--
the remainder of k 1 times k,

737
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:57,170
after dividing out this
many multiples of n

738
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:06,840
as possible, all the way to
the remainder off k r times k,

739
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:12,590
after dividing out as many
multiples of n as possible,

740
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:18,810
this set is actually equal
to the set k 1 up to k r.

741
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,910
So this is what
we're going to prove.

742
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,280
And we'll do it in two steps.

743
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:29,630
We first show that this
set has exactly r numbers.

744
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:32,570
So the cardinality of
that set is equal to r.

745
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:36,150
So that will be our
first step in the proof.

746
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:42,400
And over here we will show that
every remainder is actually

747
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,420
relatively prime to n, so
it must be part of this set.

748
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:49,580
So we will show that this
is a subset of this set

749
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,770
in a second part of the proof.

750
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:55,450
And combining those two, we
are able to prove equality.

751
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:56,435
Why's that?

752
00:47:56,435 --> 00:48:00,680
Well I have r distinct
elements in this set,

753
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,290
I have r distinct elements
in this set, this one

754
00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:05,450
is a subset of this.

755
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,890
So that can only happen
if they are equal.

756
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:12,910
So this is the
method for the proof.

757
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:16,030


758
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:31,290
I should-- so we'll start
with the first part.

759
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:34,180


760
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:40,470
And the way to do that is to
see whether it is possible

761
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:47,840
that any two remainders
in that set, can they

762
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,860
be equal to one another?

763
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,870
We will show that
that's not possible.

764
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:54,490
So if it's not possible,
then all these remainders

765
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:55,470
must be different.

766
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:57,790
And we have exactly r of those.

767
00:48:57,790 --> 00:48:59,650
So let's do this.

768
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:04,690
So the proof for
1 is as follows.

769
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:07,550
Let's assume that we
he have to remainders.

770
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:17,330
Say, k i times k, and a
remainder k j times k,

771
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,210
after dividing out as
many multiples of n.

772
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,000
And supposed that they
are equal to one another.

773
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,120
We're going to show
that this can only

774
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,120
happen if k i is equal to k j.

775
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,867
And if you can see
that, well then

776
00:49:31,867 --> 00:49:34,200
we know that all these different
remainders are actually

777
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,500
different from one another.

778
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,880
And if they're all
different from one another,

779
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,870
then we must have exactly r.

780
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:44,140
Because we have k 1
up to k r in here.

781
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:48,610
OK let's see where
we can do this.

782
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:52,210
Well, if you know that
these two remainders are

783
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:56,280
equal to one another, we can
look at them with respect

784
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:58,940
to these definitions over here.

785
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:05,110
And we can show that k
i times k is actually

786
00:50:05,110 --> 00:50:10,640
congruent to k j
times k modulo n.

787
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,170
So why is this?

788
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:15,620
Well, these two
remainders are the same.

789
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:19,370
And k i times k is
equal to this remainder,

790
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,270
plus a multiple of n.

791
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:25,650
This k j times k is equal
to this remainder plus,

792
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,350
a multiple of n.

793
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:32,179
So the difference between those
two is also a multiple of n.

794
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:33,845
And that's the
definition of congruence.

795
00:50:33,845 --> 00:50:36,880


796
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:42,510
So now we can use
our first lemma,

797
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:46,040
which is stated over here.

798
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,800
We know that we assumed
in Euler's theorem

799
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,570
that the GCD of n
and k is equal to 1.

800
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:57,170
If a times k is congruent
to b times k modulo n,

801
00:50:57,170 --> 00:50:59,910
then we know that's a is
congruent to b modulo n.

802
00:50:59,910 --> 00:51:03,420
So let's apply it over
here, and take for a k

803
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,270
i, and for b we can take k j.

804
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:16,010
So now we see that key k i
is congruent to k j modulo n.

805
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:19,300
And from this we will
conclude-- and that

806
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,900
takes an extra step-- that k
i is actually equal to k j.

807
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,950
So how can we do this?

808
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:30,870
Well, we know that k i and k
j are both in the range from 1

809
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:33,810
all the way up to n minus 1.

810
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:38,000
So if I look at the
difference between those

811
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,950
two-- so by definition
of congruence

812
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:46,780
I know that n divides
k i minus k j.

813
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:52,790
I know that this one is in the
range from 0 up to n minus 1.

814
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:55,850
This one is in the range
of 0 up to n minus 1.

815
00:51:55,850 --> 00:52:00,510
The only way how a difference
of two numbers in this range

816
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:05,250
can be divisible by n, is if
this thing is equal to zero.

817
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:09,170
And that means that
k i equals k j.

818
00:52:09,170 --> 00:52:11,200
So now we are done
with the first part,

819
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,040
because we have shown
that if I take any two

820
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,990
remainders over here it
must be that they can only

821
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:21,425
be equal to one another
if, actually, the k i is

822
00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:22,300
equal to the k j.

823
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,570
So actually we're looking
at the same remainder.

824
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:27,950
So they remainders in this
set are all different,

825
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:30,680
and there are
exactly r of those.

826
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,690
So now we go to the
second part of the proof.

827
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:49,520


828
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,370
And notice that we
are-- so far we've only

829
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,470
been proving the second
lemma, and we still

830
00:52:54,470 --> 00:52:56,990
need to go to Euler's
theorem as well.

831
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:58,375
So it still takes a few steps.

832
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:02,560


833
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,430
So how do we do the second part?

834
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,200
Well, we saw in last
lecture that we were

835
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:14,640
explaining Euclid's algorithm.

836
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,650
And we used, essentially,
this property.

837
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:22,080
We said that the greatest
common divisor between n

838
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:28,460
and the remainder of
say, k i times k and n,

839
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:33,750
is actually equal to the
greatest common divisor of n

840
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,265
and k i times k.

841
00:53:36,265 --> 00:53:39,090


842
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,340
So why is this, again?

843
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:46,320
Well, the remaining is
actually equal to k i times k,

844
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,680
minus a multiple of n, right?

845
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:53,080
So the greatest common
divisor is therefore--

846
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,720
between n and this-- is the same
as the greatest common divisor

847
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:57,840
between n and k i times k.

848
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,210
So you should have to
look at last lecture.

849
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:04,250
And now we are pretty much done.

850
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:04,790
Why is this?

851
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:07,800
Because we have assumed that
the greatest common divisor

852
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:11,631
between n and k is equal to 1.

853
00:54:11,631 --> 00:54:15,150
And k i, in the
statement of the lemma,

854
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:17,180
is relatively prime to n.

855
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:20,770
And that means, according to
the definition over there,

856
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:23,830
that the greatest common
divisor between k i and n

857
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:25,330
is also equal to 1.

858
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:35,450
So we know that both
these greatest common

859
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:39,220
divisors are equal to 1.

860
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:43,592
So that means that there is
no common divisor between n

861
00:54:43,592 --> 00:54:47,600
and these, except 1 of course.

862
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,320
So what does this say?

863
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,470
Well, this means that
this remainder, according

864
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:55,830
to our definition, is
relatively prime to n,

865
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:59,171
because this greatest common
divisor is equal to 1.

866
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:05,420
So if it is an integer
relatively prime to n,

867
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:08,460
then it must be one
of those k i's, k j's

868
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,820
in this set that is
stated in the lemma.

869
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:16,290
So this shows that it must be
part of this set over here.

870
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:20,160
So if proven, the fact
[? is ?] that the set of all

871
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:25,350
the remainders is a subset
of the set k 1 of the k r.

872
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:28,260
So now we're done.

873
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:34,730
So now that we have shown
this particular lemma,

874
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:40,420
we can continue and
prove Euler's theorem.

875
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,460
And I'll probably need
to wipe out some of this.

876
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:52,750


877
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:56,360
So let's use this lemma
to prove this theorem.

878
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:57,920
So this is really a neat trick.

879
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,350


880
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:09,510
So the proof of Euler's
theorem is as follows.

881
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:14,130
We're going to take the product
of all those k i's over there,

882
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:17,670
and see where we can
find a nice relationship.

883
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:23,540
So we take k 1 times k
2, all the way times k r.

884
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:27,290
And we know, because those two
sets are actually the same,

885
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:30,310
that this is equal
to the remainder--

886
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:37,230
the first remainder--
k 1 times k,

887
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:39,520
after dividing out as
many multiples of n.

888
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,340
And we go all the way
up to the final one,

889
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:47,980
the remainder of k r
times k, dividing out

890
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,280
as many multiples of n.

891
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:55,800
So now we can see that--
well, we've already

892
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,480
shown that each of
those remainders

893
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,650
is congruent to, in
this case, this one

894
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:05,210
is congruent to k
1 times k modulo n.

895
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:08,190
And this one is congruent
to k r times k modulo n.

896
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,650
So let's write it out.

897
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:12,430
So it's k 1 times k.

898
00:57:12,430 --> 00:57:16,140
And then we have k 2 times k.

899
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:23,890
And finally we have
k r times k modulo n.

900
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:26,910
So let's regroup those.

901
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:30,580
We see k 1, k 2, all the
way up to k r reappearing.

902
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:35,660


903
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:39,770
And we have a k here,
a k here, and we

904
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:42,630
have that r times--
so we have times

905
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:47,990
k to the power r modulo n.

906
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:52,250
So now we are able to, again,
use this particular lemma

907
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,990
over here.

908
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:55,560
So what do we do?

909
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:01,115
Well, we know that k 1
is relatively prime to n.

910
00:58:01,115 --> 00:58:04,590
And k 2 is as well,
all the way up to k r.

911
00:58:04,590 --> 00:58:08,450
So this whole product is also
relatively prime, with respect

912
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:09,979
to n.

913
00:58:09,979 --> 00:58:11,770
That means that the
greatest common divisor

914
00:58:11,770 --> 00:58:17,060
of this whole product
with n is equal to 1.

915
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:21,920
So that means that I can
divide out this whole product.

916
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,190
We have-- so let's do this.

917
00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:28,300
We have 1 times this product.

918
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:33,960
We take this for a,
and we take this for b.

919
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,770
And then we can divide
this whole thing out

920
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:40,600
according to this
particular lemma,

921
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,760
by using the multiplicative
inverse of that product.

922
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:49,690
So now we see that the 1 is
equal to k to the power r

923
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:51,720
modulo n.

924
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:56,010
And remember, in our
theorem, r over here

925
00:58:56,010 --> 00:59:02,500
in this lemma-- r is
actually equal to the Euler's

926
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,740
totient function in n.

927
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:09,780
So now this equation
proves the whole theorem.

928
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:15,890
OK, so now I'm going
to talk about RSA,

929
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,890
which is the last part here.

930
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:20,080
So maybe you all
would like to have

931
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,430
a little break of a couple of
minutes, just to relax a bit.

932
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,540
And then-- and shake
hands with your neighbors,

933
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:30,150
and jump up in the
air if you'd like to.

934
00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:33,590
All right let's start
with the RSA algorithm.

935
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:37,480
So we have done everything
up to this point.

936
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,150
And we are actually-- we have
done these two over here.

937
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:45,300
We still have to talk about
Fermat's little theorem.

938
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:48,990
But then we can go for RSA,
and it uses this consequence

939
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:52,470
of Euler's theorem.

940
00:59:52,470 --> 01:00:04,130
So Fermat's little
theorem is actually

941
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:08,154
talking about what happens
if n is a prime number.

942
01:00:08,154 --> 01:00:11,640


943
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:14,340
It says, well,
suppose p is a prime.

944
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:19,830


945
01:00:19,830 --> 01:00:25,100
And if you have k in the
range 1, 2, all the way up

946
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:32,010
to p minus 1, then we
can conclude that k

947
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:37,770
to the power of p minus 1
is congruent to 1 modulo n.

948
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:44,150
And we can directly prove
this by using Euler's theorem.

949
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:46,340
So how do we do this?

950
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,300
Well, we know that p is prime.

951
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:57,380
So the numbers 1, 2, all
the way up to p minus 1,

952
01:00:57,380 --> 01:01:01,880
are actually
relatively prime to p.

953
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,000


954
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:05,710
So why is that?

955
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:06,920
Well, p is prime.

956
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,257
So the greatest common divisor
between any of those with p

957
01:01:10,257 --> 01:01:10,840
is equal to 1.

958
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,640
That's the definition
of relatively prime.

959
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:21,070
And we know that
we can now apply

960
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:23,370
Euler's theorem
over here, and see

961
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:31,640
that k to the power phi of
p is, of course, congruent

962
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,390
to 1 modulo p.

963
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:36,430
That's Euler's theorem.

964
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:39,510
But now, since we know that
these are the exact ones that

965
01:01:39,510 --> 01:01:42,930
are relatively prime,
we can explicitly

966
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:46,290
compute the Euler's
totient function of p.

967
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:48,250
Because there are p
minus 1 numbers that

968
01:01:48,250 --> 01:01:50,480
are relatively prime to p.

969
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,530
So that's the
definition over here.

970
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:57,870
So the number of integers in
the range 1 up to p minus 1--

971
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:00,040
they're all relatively prime.

972
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:09,060
So we know that 5 p
is equal to p minus 1.

973
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:14,140
So now we have shown that
k to the power of p minus 1

974
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:18,320
is congruent to 1 modulo k.

975
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:22,260
This is kind of interesting
because we can use this theorem

976
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,170
also to compute the
multiplicative inverse of k,

977
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,830
in this particular case.

978
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:31,430
So how do we do this?

979
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:35,250
We just take k,
and we look at what

980
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:41,690
happens if you multiply k with
k to the power of p minus 2.

981
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:46,340
Well, this is equal to k to
the power p minus 1, which

982
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:56,047
is congruent to 1 modulo p
according to Fermat's theorem.

983
01:02:56,047 --> 01:02:57,630
So now, when we look
at the definition

984
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:01,220
of multiplicative
inverse over here,

985
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:05,240
we see that k to
the power p minus 2

986
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,755
is actually the
multiplicative inverse of k.

987
01:03:07,755 --> 01:03:10,350


988
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:15,240
So k inverse is actually
equal to k to the power

989
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:22,340
p minus 2 modulo k.

990
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,180
All right, so this theorem
we're going to use now

991
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:26,290
in the description of RSA.

992
01:03:26,290 --> 01:03:29,850


993
01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:36,440
As I said, it was only
decades later, after Turing,

994
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,480
Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman
were the first to really show

995
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,430
how number theory
could be applied so

996
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:44,900
successfully in cryptography.

997
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:48,850
And they essentially showed
the first public key encryption

998
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:52,130
scheme in which a sender and
receiver do not necessarily

999
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:54,250
have to exchange a secret key.

1000
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:55,460
That's not necessary.

1001
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:59,140
So they had a public key method.

1002
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:04,880
And that's still used today,
and it's a great inventions.

1003
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,820
So how does the RSA work?

1004
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:10,300
Again, we have to talk
with an encryption scheme

1005
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,830
about what happens beforehand.

1006
01:04:12,830 --> 01:04:17,320
So beforehand, we need to
generate this public key

1007
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,660
and a secret key.

1008
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:32,320
So the idea is that the receiver
creates a public key, and also

1009
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:33,250
a secret key.

1010
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:36,910


1011
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:39,020
He will publish the public
key, and he will keep

1012
01:04:39,020 --> 01:04:40,760
the secret key for himself.

1013
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,750
And now anybody can
use the public key

1014
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:46,680
to encrypt a message.

1015
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:49,690
The encrypted message
is sent to the receiver,

1016
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:52,930
and he's going to use his
secret key to get back

1017
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:55,890
to the plain message.

1018
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:57,880
So how is he going to do this?

1019
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,860
Well in the first
step, the idea is

1020
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:05,730
to generate two distinct primes.

1021
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:10,190
Turns out that this can be
done in a very efficient way.

1022
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:14,020
There are lots of primes
among the integers.

1023
01:05:14,020 --> 01:05:15,710
So you just sample.

1024
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:21,150
And it turns out that
you can test primality

1025
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,756
with a pretty high
probability, very efficiently.

1026
01:05:23,756 --> 01:05:25,130
And recently,
actually, there has

1027
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:29,094
been a deterministic
algorithm that is polynomial.

1028
01:05:29,094 --> 01:05:30,510
And a number of
bits of the primes

1029
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,710
that can actually tell you
whether you have a prime

1030
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:34,220
or not.

1031
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:35,050
So you can do this.

1032
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:37,700


1033
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:41,760
Two, we're going to create
the product of these two

1034
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:42,790
distinct primes.

1035
01:05:42,790 --> 01:05:47,000
And that's where our
assumption is going to help us.

1036
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,470
That it is hard to factor a
product of two large primes.

1037
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:54,740
That's going to be the
underlying hardness assumption

1038
01:05:54,740 --> 01:05:57,110
of the RSA encryption scheme.

1039
01:05:57,110 --> 01:05:59,660


1040
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:02,840
So let n be this.

1041
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:11,790
Three, we are going to
select an integer e,

1042
01:06:11,790 --> 01:06:16,960
such that the greatest
common divisor of e

1043
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:22,060
with the product p
minus 1 times q minus 1

1044
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:25,850
is actually equal to 1.

1045
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:30,470
And the public-- and once
we have created this,

1046
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:40,270
the public key is going
to be a pair that consists

1047
01:06:40,270 --> 01:06:44,650
of e itself together with n.

1048
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:46,670
So that's the public key.

1049
01:06:46,670 --> 01:06:51,800
And the secret key is going
to be computed as follows,

1050
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,315
in step four.

1051
01:06:54,315 --> 01:06:55,315
We are going to compute.

1052
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:58,750


1053
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:09,290
d, such that d times e
is congruent to 1 modulo

1054
01:07:09,290 --> 01:07:16,010
that product of p minus
1 times q minus 1.

1055
01:07:16,010 --> 01:07:17,260
Can we do this?

1056
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:21,180
Yeah, because the greatest
common divisor between e

1057
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:23,860
and that product is equal to 1.

1058
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:26,770
And we have shown over
here that, therefore, it

1059
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,790
has a multiplicative inverse.

1060
01:07:28,790 --> 01:07:32,820
And first of all, we know
that the solution d exists,

1061
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:36,070
and we can also
efficiently compute it.

1062
01:07:36,070 --> 01:07:48,030
So the secret key is
going to be the pair that

1063
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,730
consists of d and also n.

1064
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:53,530
So how does it work?

1065
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:58,720
The sender knows the
public key, e and n,

1066
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,690
and uses those to
encrypt a message.

1067
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,340
I will explain it in a moment.

1068
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:07,510
And then the receiver knows
the secret key, d and n,

1069
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:10,130
and then is able to decrypt.

1070
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:15,050
OK, so let's see how
encryption works.

1071
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:18,170
And then we will have to
do a lot of mathematics

1072
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:21,060
to get the decryption going.

1073
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:27,330
So m prime, which is computed--
so the encrypted plain text is

1074
01:08:27,330 --> 01:08:31,410
computed as the remainder
of m to the power e--

1075
01:08:31,410 --> 01:08:33,870
which is part of
the public key--

1076
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:38,850
and then dividing out as many
multiples of n as possible.

1077
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:43,859
It turns out-- and we are going
to prove this-- that decryption

1078
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:46,720
works as follows.

1079
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:50,760
We can compute m
by using m prime.

1080
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,880
So we receive m prime.

1081
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,100
What do we do?

1082
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:58,000
We're going to take m prime,
raise it to the power d-- which

1083
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,710
is part of the secret
key-- and then dividing out

1084
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:04,890
as many multiples of n.

1085
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:08,200
Now, why would that work?

1086
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:09,240
Why would this work?

1087
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,979
So let's prove this
step over here.

1088
01:09:12,979 --> 01:09:15,590


1089
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:20,439
Well, it turns out that they
can apply Fermat's theorem,

1090
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:23,430
and the idea is as follows.

1091
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:24,790
So let's have a look.

1092
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:31,100
We know that m prime is equal
to the remainder of m raised

1093
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:35,450
to the power e, which
is congruent to m

1094
01:09:35,450 --> 01:09:39,029
to the power e, modulo n.

1095
01:09:39,029 --> 01:09:42,200
We've seen this now a
number of times, right?

1096
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,310
So what does this imply?

1097
01:09:45,310 --> 01:09:52,939
This implies that m prime to
the power d is actually equal--

1098
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:57,900
is congruent to m to the
power e, to the power d.

1099
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:00,390
So I just raised this
side to the power d,

1100
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:03,030
and I raised this
side to the power d.

1101
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:08,390
And I still-- and
I know, now, that m

1102
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:11,540
prime to the power d is
equal to m to the power e d--

1103
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:15,420
congruent to m to the
power e d modulo n.

1104
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:19,970
So now we know that there
exists an integer r.

1105
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:23,450
We are going to use the
fact that we have that e

1106
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:26,280
and p minus 1 times q
minus 1 as a greatest

1107
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:28,020
common divisor over 1.

1108
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:35,290
So we know that e times
d is actually equal to 1,

1109
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:40,320
plus r times p minus
1, times q minus 1.

1110
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:46,310
Actually, what I use here is
the fact-- is this over here.

1111
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:48,710
By definition of
congruency, I know

1112
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:51,390
that the difference
between those two-- d times

1113
01:10:51,390 --> 01:10:55,430
e and 1-- is divisible
by this product.

1114
01:10:55,430 --> 01:10:57,590
So I know that there
exists an integer such

1115
01:10:57,590 --> 01:11:02,070
that e times d equals 1, plus
a multiple of that product.

1116
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:04,860
That's how it works.

1117
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:08,800
So we know that m
prime to the power

1118
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:14,670
d-- we already saw that it is
equal to m to the power e d,

1119
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,410
which is congruent
to-- well, we just

1120
01:11:17,410 --> 01:11:20,960
replace e d by 1 plus
r times this multiple.

1121
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:25,220
So we have m to the
power 1, times m

1122
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:31,026
to the power-- this part--
r p minus 1, q minus 1.

1123
01:11:31,026 --> 01:11:35,220


1124
01:11:35,220 --> 01:11:45,450
So now we're finally going
get to Fermat's theorem.

1125
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:48,820
We know that n is the
products of p and q,

1126
01:11:48,820 --> 01:11:52,260
and I'm not actually
sure I do this here.

1127
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:55,130


1128
01:11:55,130 --> 01:12:00,870
So let's apply Fermat's theorem
and see how we can use this.

1129
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:08,320
So if m is not
congruent to 0 modulo p,

1130
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:11,580
well then we can apply
Fermat's theorem.

1131
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:12,080
Where is it?

1132
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:14,480
It's over here.

1133
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:18,830
We can only apply this if
k is in the range from 1

1134
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:21,640
to p minus 1 is
not equal to zero.

1135
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:27,020
So if m is not equal to 0--
not congruent to 0 modulo p--

1136
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:30,700
then we can apply
the theorem and state

1137
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:37,960
that m to the power p minus
1 is congruent to 1 modulo p.

1138
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:42,440
And in the same way,
we can do this for q.

1139
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:48,880
So if this is not
true-- modulo q-- then m

1140
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:54,120
to the power q minus 1 is
congruent to 1 modulo q.

1141
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,840
So here we have used
Fermat's theorem twice.

1142
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,890


1143
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:04,330
Now we can apply what
we have learned before,

1144
01:13:04,330 --> 01:13:07,990
which is what we
wrote down over here.

1145
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:13,110
And prime to the power d is
congruent to this modulo n.

1146
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:17,890
Now n is p times q, so let's
have a look at what that means.

1147
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:23,140
It means that since n
is a product of p and q,

1148
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:27,730
we can also look at
this congruent modulo p.

1149
01:13:27,730 --> 01:13:32,170
So in particular, we know
that m prime to the power

1150
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:39,190
d is congruent to m times
m r p minus 1 times q minus

1151
01:13:39,190 --> 01:13:42,280
1 modulo p.

1152
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,540
Why is that?

1153
01:13:43,540 --> 01:13:46,670
Well, we know that n
divides this difference

1154
01:13:46,670 --> 01:13:49,270
by the definition of congruency.

1155
01:13:49,270 --> 01:13:52,450
n is equal to p times q.

1156
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:56,270
So if n is dividing
this difference,

1157
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:58,770
also p is dividing
this difference.

1158
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:01,140
So that's why we can write
it m prime to the power d

1159
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:05,380
is congruent to this
thing, modulo p.

1160
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:08,560
And of course, we can
repeat this for q.

1161
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:11,100


1162
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:12,940
So let me write
this out as well.

1163
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:17,930


1164
01:14:17,930 --> 01:14:18,890
So there it is.

1165
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:21,600


1166
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:28,400
So now we can there use what
we have figured out over here.

1167
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:33,560
So we know that if
m is not equal to 0,

1168
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:38,180
then this thing over
here cancels out.

1169
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:43,000
Because m to the power p
minus 1 is congruent to 1.

1170
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,690
So we have that m
prime to the power

1171
01:14:47,690 --> 01:14:55,490
d is congruent to m
modulo p, if m is not

1172
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:57,460
congruent to 0 modulo p, right?

1173
01:14:57,460 --> 01:14:59,550
Because if m is not
congruent to zero,

1174
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:01,150
we have this
particular equation.

1175
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:04,100
We plug it in over
here, this all cancels,

1176
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:06,840
and we just are left with m.

1177
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:12,080
Now, if m is equal-- is
congruent-- to 0 modulo p,

1178
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,050
then we can see that
it is equal to 0.

1179
01:15:16,050 --> 01:15:18,210
So it's equal to 0.

1180
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:21,600
So this actually
holds for any case.

1181
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:27,680
Now we can do the same for
q-- the same argument--

1182
01:15:27,680 --> 01:15:30,680
and show that this must hold.

1183
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:35,110
So now we know that p
divides the difference

1184
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:38,225
of m prime d minus m.

1185
01:15:38,225 --> 01:15:43,190
q is another prime that
divides this difference.

1186
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:49,280
And the only way that's possible
is if the product of p and q

1187
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:55,130
is dividing this particular
number-- this difference.

1188
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:58,230
And we have two different
primes dividing the same number,

1189
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:00,290
so the product
must [? divided. ?]

1190
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:08,770
So p times q divides
m prime d minus m.

1191
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:12,040
Oh, but p times q is equal to n.

1192
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,230
So now we're almost
done, because now we

1193
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:18,010
can state-- by the
definition of congruency--

1194
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:26,350
that m prime to the power d
is congruent to m modulo n.

1195
01:16:26,350 --> 01:16:32,200
Now, since m is a message that's
in the range of-- so I did not

1196
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,030
write it down here--
so m is a message

1197
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:40,440
which is in the range of 0
all the way up to n minus 1.

1198
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:43,440
We know, and we have seen it
before with Turing's code,

1199
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,200
that we can rewrite this
and say that m equals

1200
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:50,960
the remainder of m
prime to the power

1201
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:57,100
d, after multiplying out as
many multiples of n as possible.

1202
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,060
So here you go.

1203
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:02,180
So this is the decryption
rule, and it works.

1204
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:06,640
We have shown that this
equation truly holds.

1205
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:10,250
So RSA has really
withstood the test of time.

1206
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,250
It's already out there
for many decades,

1207
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:15,322
and it's still widely used.

1208
01:17:15,322 --> 01:17:17,030
I wanted to talk a
little bit about this,

1209
01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:19,580
but there seemed not
to be enough time.

1210
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:26,570
But I'd just like to mention
that only 2009 Craig Gentry

1211
01:17:26,570 --> 01:17:32,250
proved a beautiful theorem,
and was able to evaluate

1212
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,250
Boolean circuits.

1213
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:37,650
Or, say, certain types of
programs under encryption.

1214
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:41,040
So you can sort of add
and multiply cypher text

1215
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,310
encryptions together, and it
is as if you multiply them

1216
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:46,700
at the plain text level.

1217
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:50,720
That was a fantastic-- that
was an enormous open problem.

1218
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,030
And he solved it.

1219
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:55,850
And only a few months
earlier, in 2010,

1220
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:59,810
in joint work with Craig and
some other colleagues at IBM,

1221
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:02,570
we showed it with
very simple arithmetic

1222
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:07,120
that just uses modulo p and
modulo 2 kind of things.

1223
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:11,450
We could show a
construction this

1224
01:18:11,450 --> 01:18:13,490
has such a property--
such an encryption

1225
01:18:13,490 --> 01:18:15,100
scheme of the integers.

1226
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:18,130
So there's still a lot of
stuff going on in this area.

1227
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:21,780
And really, we use this
type of very basic stuff.

1228
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:25,450
The problem in cryptography
is to show that it is secure.

1229
01:18:25,450 --> 01:18:28,330
So you have to show
that breaking the scheme

1230
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:32,190
needs to be reduced to
some really hard problem.

1231
01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:34,920
And that is always the
really difficult part

1232
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,200
of such type of research.

1233
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,950
OK, well, have lots of
fun with recitation.

1234
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:44,609
