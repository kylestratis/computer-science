00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:24,780


10
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,497
PROFESSOR: OK,
let's get started.

11
00:00:26,497 --> 00:00:29,400


12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,520
Last week we talked
about random variables.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,540
And this week
we're going to talk

14
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,550
about their expected value.

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,000
The expected value
of a random variable

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,637
comes up in all sorts
of applications.

17
00:00:42,637 --> 00:00:44,720
We're going to spend a
whole week talking about it

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,980
and some of next week
talking about variations

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,496
from the expected value.

20
00:00:48,496 --> 00:00:49,870
And it's probably
one of the best

21
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,190
tools you have for
working with probability

22
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,289
problems in practice.

23
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:55,747
So let's write down
the definition.

24
00:00:55,747 --> 00:01:04,129


25
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:12,320
The expected value
also has other names.

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:23,570
It's also known as the
average or the mean

27
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,683
of a random variable.

28
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:29,390


29
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:41,950
Random variable R over
a probability space S

30
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,520
is denoted by a lot of ways.

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,760
We're going to use Ex
to denote it, Ex of R.

32
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,070
And it's the sum over all
possible outcomes in the sample

33
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,670
space of the value of
the random variable

34
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:01,190
on that outcome times the
probability of that outcome.

35
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,310
In other words, the expected
value of a random variable

36
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,080
is just a weighted average
of all possible values

37
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,380
of the random variable where
the weight is the probability

38
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,910
of that happening.

39
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:27,438
For example, suppose we
roll a fair six sided die.

40
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,860


41
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,810
So the numbers that
come up are 1 to 6.

42
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,890
And we let R be the
random variable denoting

43
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,135
the outcome, 1 through 6.

44
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:43,330


45
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,990
So the expected
value of the role,

46
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:50,160
we can easily compute
from the definition.

47
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,890
Well, there's a 1/6 chance
that it comes out a 1.

48
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,200
The next outcome would be a 2.

49
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,600
That happens with 1/6 chance.

50
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,025
3, 4, 5, and six all
happen with a 1/6 chance.

51
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:06,680


52
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:13,000
If I sum up 1, 2, 3, 4 up to
6, I get 6 times 7 over 2 times

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,910
the 1/6 is just 7
over 2 or 3 and 1/2.

54
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,590


55
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,320
So expected value when I roll
a die, a fair six sided die,

56
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
is just 3 and 1/2.

57
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,880
And as you can see
from this example,

58
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,210
the expected value doesn't
have to be attainable by one

59
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,030
of the outcomes.

60
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,730
You don't get a 3 and
1/2 when you roll a die.

61
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,840
But that's the average value.

62
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,080
Now the expected value, the
expectation, the average,

63
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,812
the mean, they're
all the same thing.

64
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:48,770
They're all defined based
on a random variable.

65
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,890
They all mean the same thing.

66
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:54,384
They are all different
than the median.

67
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:55,800
That's something
that's different.

68
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,400
So let me define the median.

69
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,090
Basically it is the
outcome which splits

70
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,390
the probabilities in half.

71
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,030
In other words, you've
got a 50% chance

72
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,260
of being bigger than the median
and a 50% chance of being

73
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,760
smaller.

74
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:17,209
Now precisely you can
define it this way.

75
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:24,950
The median of a
random variable R

76
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:35,300
is the value in the range of
R such that the probability

77
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,700
that the random variable is
less than this median point is

78
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,020
at most 1/2.

79
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,330
And the probability
that random variable

80
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:48,086
is bigger than the median
is strictly less than 1/2.

81
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:50,910


82
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,950
Now, some texts
do it differently.

83
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,944
They swap this less than
or equal to with this one.

84
00:04:56,944 --> 00:04:58,610
And it could give you
a different answer

85
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,170
if you do that.

86
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,506
And I think in the text,
actually, we screwed it up.

87
00:05:04,506 --> 00:05:05,880
So we have to get
that corrected.

88
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,796
I think we might have
put a less than or equal

89
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:09,990
here, which is not
the right definition.

90
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,160
So this is the right
definition that we'll use.

91
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,730
So using this definition,
what is the median

92
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:20,950
of the random variable that
corresponds to rolling a die?

93
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,551
What's the median when I
roll a six sided fair die?

94
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:27,810


95
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,820
Not 3 and 1/2, because it's
got to be one of the values.

96
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,652
The median does have
to be in the realm

97
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:36,610
of the random variable.

98
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,340
It has to one of the
attainable values.

99
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,900
What's the median value
when I roll a die?

100
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,280
AUDIENCE: Four.

101
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:43,980
PROFESSOR: Four.

102
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,580
Let's try that out.

103
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,620
If I plug in 4 here, the
probability I'm less than 4

104
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,790
is 1/2.

105
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,540
Could be 1, 2, or 3.

106
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,330
The probability of greater
than 4 is 5 or six is 1/3.

107
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,470
That's less than 1/2.

108
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,280
So 4 works.

109
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,290
3 doesn't work, because the
probability I'm bigger than 3

110
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,710
is 1/2.

111
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,296
So it doesn't work.

112
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:10,170
And the other definition
sometimes people use

113
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,960
would turn out that
three is the median.

114
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,560


115
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
Now, we're not going
to spend any more

116
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,330
time talking about the median.

117
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,430
What's really important in
probability is the mean.

118
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,170
And that's because
you can do a whole lot

119
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,970
more with it in applications.

120
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:31,770
Any question about the
definitions so far?

121
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,890
All right, so now we're going to
do a more interesting example.

122
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,780
We're going to play
a gambling game

123
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,110
and we're going to analyze the
expected winnings, the expected

124
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,810
return.

125
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,090
And this is a simple
three person game

126
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:52,480
that you can see played
in bars and informally.

127
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,590
But to play it I
need a volunteer

128
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:57,625
from the class, somebody
who wants to play.

129
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,250
You've done it.

130
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,041
Who hasn't done it?

131
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,359
Have you done it?

132
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:01,150
You haven't played.

133
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,012
Do you have money
in your pocket?

134
00:07:03,012 --> 00:07:04,220
You got to borrow some money.

135
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,048
If you don't have any money,
you got to borrow some.

136
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:08,770
AUDIENCE: How much money?

137
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,560
PROFESSOR: Oh, I
don't know, $5 or $10.

138
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,120
Got it?

139
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,507
All right, come on down.

140
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:15,746


141
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:17,620
you're going to play
against a couple of TAs.

142
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,910
Maybe a couple of you
will want to play.

143
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,630
I'll get Nick and
Martyna to play here.

144
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,960
Now, this is a very simple game.

145
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,060
In each round, each of the
players is going to wager $2.

146
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,950
So I can loan you guys
some money here, I guess.

147
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,741
So you have $2?

148
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:41,240
All right, I have
to loan you money.

149
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,646
I better count this out.

150
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:44,354
AUDIENCE: I think I
can find the Zimbabwe

151
00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:45,900
dollars I had here somewhere.

152
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,260
PROFESSOR: I don't know
if I'm taking those.

153
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,426
Here, you can split that up.

154
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,850
I loaned you guys $10 there.

155
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,880
You got $2.

156
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,780
Put it on the table.

157
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,760
Wager your $2.

158
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,160
Now what we're going
to do is they're each

159
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,230
going to guess the
results of a coin toss.

160
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,371
We'll put the pot
together here, mix it up.

161
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:06,370
You only have to do two.

162
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,250
You can save those for now.

163
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,420
Oh, that's your two.

164
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,220
All right, so we
have $6 in the pot.

165
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,670
Now, each of you is going to
guess the outcome of a coin.

166
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,330
So here's the guesses.

167
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,930
Heads or tails, that's for you.

168
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,399
Heads or tails,
the guess for you.

169
00:08:21,399 --> 00:08:22,690
And you get a heads or a tails.

170
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,270
So instead of writing
it down, you're

171
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,070
going to sort of
hide those, maybe

172
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,820
get some advice from
the class, and you're

173
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:32,409
going to pick one and put it on
the table here as your guess.

174
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,650
And then one of you out
there is going to flip a coin

175
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,909
and announce the
result. And then we're

176
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:42,480
going to reveal their
guesses and the winners

177
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,670
split the money.

178
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,940
And if there's no winners,
well, they take their $2 back

179
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,570
and they split the pot.

180
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,520
So this is a very fair game.

181
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,810
They make their
choices, you guys

182
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:57,350
toss the coin, and the
winners share of the pot.

183
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,650
If there's one, winner they get
$6, which is a profit of $4.

184
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,480
Two winners, they each
get three, profit of one,

185
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,790
the other one's out two bucks.

186
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,940
Nobody wins, they get
their money back, profit 0.

187
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,300
They all win, they get
their money back, profit 0.

188
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,520
Is the game clear?

189
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,810
Who's got a coin out there?

190
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:17,030
You've got a coin?

191
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,870
Very good.

192
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,510
Now you've got to
guess the coin.

193
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,520
Don't show each
other your guesses.

194
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,459
And put your guesses
on the table here.

195
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:27,750
You get to pick heads or tails.

196
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,583
Put it on the table.

197
00:09:28,583 --> 00:09:35,270


198
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,620
[LAUGHS]

199
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,950
This is not a hard game.

200
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,140


201
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,710
You got a heads
and a tails, right?

202
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,198
Well, yeah, did you put a
heads or a tails in there?

203
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:51,650
Yeah, there's one
heads, one tails.

204
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,420
No, that's blank.

205
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,909
You don't win that way.

206
00:09:53,909 --> 00:09:54,450
There you go.

207
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,158
That's the tails.

208
00:09:55,158 --> 00:09:56,940
AUDIENCE: I thought you meant--

209
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,690
PROFESSOR: Heads.

210
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:59,418
So if you want heads,
you go like that.

211
00:09:59,418 --> 00:09:59,846
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

212
00:09:59,846 --> 00:10:01,560
I thought you meant
do it the other way.

213
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,345
PROFESSOR: There you go.

214
00:10:02,345 --> 00:10:04,205
AUDIENCE: All right, I'll have
to make these indistinguishable

215
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:05,140
now.

216
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,140
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah.

217
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,030
One of them is
all ripped up now.

218
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,490
They already guessed, so they've
already done their guess.

219
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,800
So you pick one
and put it there.

220
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,425
AUDIENCE: This is
what I was originally

221
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:15,997
going to guess anyway.

222
00:10:15,997 --> 00:10:17,080
PROFESSOR: So that's good.

223
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:24,690
And you now flip the coin
and tell us what it came out.

224
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,562
AUDIENCE: Heads.

225
00:10:25,562 --> 00:10:26,270
PROFESSOR: Heads.

226
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,811
All right, let's
reveal your choices.

227
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:30,280


228
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,930
All right, so there's one heads.

229
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,780
Martyna takes all the money.

230
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,377
Just bad luck there, right?

231
00:10:37,377 --> 00:10:38,460
We're going to play again.

232
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,793
We're going to play a few times.

233
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:43,490
But let's start recording
what happened here.

234
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,850
So the coin came out heads.

235
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,005
OK, remind me your name?

236
00:10:48,005 --> 00:10:48,630
AUDIENCE: Adam.

237
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:50,950
PROFESSOR: Adam gassed tails.

238
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:54,850


239
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,061
And Martyna.

240
00:10:56,061 --> 00:10:59,230


241
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,290
Is it Y?

242
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:07,680
Martyna guessed heads and
Nick, he also loses at tails.

243
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,780
So in this case Adam is out $2.

244
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:16,800
Martyna got a profit of $4.

245
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,230
And Nick is also down $2.

246
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,800
All right, let's try it again.

247
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,500
So again, pick another
heads or tails.

248
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,802
Adam's busily working
out probabilities here.

249
00:11:30,802 --> 00:11:33,010
Well you got to put your
money on the table here now.

250
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,700
You got $2.

251
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,480
That's three.

252
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,517
Here you go.

253
00:11:38,517 --> 00:11:39,990
[LAUGHS]

254
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,490
There we go.

255
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,330
Two more dollars.

256
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,390
You can make change if you want.

257
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,650
There we go.

258
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,990
All right, make your choices.

259
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,800
You got one?

260
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,050
As long as you guys don't
show him your choices,

261
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,340
we should be good here, I think.

262
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,790
And you got to pick one here.

263
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:00,140


264
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,640
Very good.

265
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,370
Can we have a coin toss please?

266
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,300
AUDIENCE: Heads.

267
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,460
PROFESSOR: Heads again.

268
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,560
What do we got?

269
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,480
All right, good job.

270
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,506
OK, Adam got heads and
Martyna's on a roll here.

271
00:12:11,506 --> 00:12:12,630
So we got to split this up.

272
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,360
Can you make change
for him here?

273
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,080
He gets $3.

274
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,750
So it was heads.

275
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,870
Adam had heads, Martyna has
heads, and Nick's in trouble.

276
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:28,180
Nick's off another
$2 of my money.

277
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,690
Martyna is up $1 because she
wagered two and got three

278
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,570
and Adam is up $1
here for that one.

279
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,420
All right, let's make
another selection.

280
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,700
Heads or tails?

281
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,860
Put the money up here, $2.

282
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:47,786
Going to need another
loan here, Nick?

283
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:49,410
AUDIENCE: I can
throw in my keys.

284
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,910
PROFESSOR: No, no.

285
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,889
AUDIENCE: The keys to
my non-existent car.

286
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:53,930
PROFESSOR: You got money?

287
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:54,610
OK.

288
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,335
All right.

289
00:12:55,335 --> 00:12:55,790
AUDIENCE: I got a lot of money.

290
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,373
PROFESSOR: Oh, very
good, that's good.

291
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:59,976
That's what we
like to hear here.

292
00:12:59,976 --> 00:13:01,600
AUDIENCE: That's what
he likes to hear.

293
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,590
PROFESSOR: Everybody
make a choice.

294
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,050
Heads or tails?

295
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,690
Now, you all want
to be thinking, OK,

296
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,275
what's going on here?

297
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:11,400
We're going to figure out
expectations in a minute,

298
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,191
do the tree method.

299
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,080
Is there any catch going on?

300
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,580
Not that we would
have a catch here.

301
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,150
OK, put a heads or tails down.

302
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,475
OK, coin toss please.

303
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:23,185


304
00:13:23,185 --> 00:13:24,210
AUDIENCE: Tails.

305
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:24,920
PROFESSOR: Tails.

306
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,160
What do we got?

307
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,150
A winner, a winner, and a loser.

308
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,130
So we got tails, tails, tails.

309
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:40,210
Nick has lost another $2.

310
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,840
Martyna's cruising and
Adam is back to even.

311
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,900
Good job.

312
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,110
AUDIENCE: Can I cash out now?

313
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,040
PROFESSOR: Well,
you're only even.

314
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,354
You've got to get ahead here.

315
00:13:50,354 --> 00:13:51,562
All right, let's do it again.

316
00:13:51,562 --> 00:13:57,790


317
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,330
$2.

318
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:59,676
Everybody got $2 on the table?

319
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:02,650


320
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,120
I'm going to have to loan.

321
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,370
You got money?

322
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:05,870
You got it.

323
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:08,100
OK.

324
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,150
See, my hope is
Nick loses track.

325
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,110
OK, make a choice please.

326
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:19,760


327
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,690
Coin toss, please.

328
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,520
AUDIENCE: Tails.

329
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,228
PROFESSOR: Tails.

330
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:25,770
What do we got?

331
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,660
Heads.

332
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,746
Martyna, Nick!

333
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:31,360
Oh, for goodness sake.

334
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,330
AUDIENCE: She's
psychic, I tell you.

335
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,580
PROFESSOR: Martyna wins again.

336
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,460
You didn't make a deal
with him, did you?

337
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

338
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,270
PROFESSOR: Nick and Martyna are
perfect and Adam is down again.

339
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:50,670


340
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:53,050
Let's collect your money.

341
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:54,440
She gets it all.

342
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,380
Oh, she got four here.

343
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,590
Yeah, she made four.

344
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,590
Good point.

345
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,410
Because she won it all.

346
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,610
Very good.

347
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,981
All right, let's put
the next wager up.

348
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:07,970


349
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,670
Nick, if I were you, I wouldn't
do much gambling in life.

350
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:13,970
[LAUGHS] You got
any money left Adam?

351
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,582
AUDIENCE: I'm going
to have a big win.

352
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,540
PROFESSOR: There it is.

353
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,498
Working on the big win.

354
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:18,660
There we go.

355
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,510
AUDIENCE: I'm running
out of ones here.

356
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,277
PROFESSOR: Martyna can
make change for you.

357
00:15:24,277 --> 00:15:25,360
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Martyna.

358
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,950


359
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:32,010
Do you have change for a 10?

360
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:34,520
PROFESSOR: All right.

361
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,655
There we go.

362
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:37,530
A couple bucks there.

363
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:38,779
And then make your selections.

364
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:42,260


365
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,380
Okey doke.

366
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,550
It's a pretty fair game.

367
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,860
They put the money in,
the winners split the pot.

368
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,760
You guys flip the coin after
they make their selections.

369
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,360
OK, make a selection.

370
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,860
Martyna has hers.

371
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,820
Adam's ready and Nick is ready.

372
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,550
Can we have a coin toss?

373
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,550
AUDIENCE: Tails.

374
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,390
PROFESSOR: Tails.

375
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:03,006
What do we got?

376
00:16:03,006 --> 00:16:03,720
Nick!

377
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,440
Congratulations.

378
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,450
Nick wins big.

379
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:09,020
All right.

380
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,790
Tails, heads, heads, tails.

381
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,470
Nick, $4.

382
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,050
He's climbing back.

383
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,800
And Martyna lost for
the first time $2.

384
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,320
Poor Adam is sinking
a little bit here.

385
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,840
All right, one more.

386
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,790
So who collects?

387
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,960
Nick, do you want
to collect this?

388
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,920
Start paying off the debts,
but save $2 for the last round.

389
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,690
This yours?

390
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,867
Yeah, there's a last one.

391
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:37,950
All right, two more bucks.

392
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,704
Last round.

393
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:43,300


394
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,535
OK, make your selections.

395
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:47,860


396
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,920
Martyna's ready.

397
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,700
Nick is ready.

398
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,025
OK, Adam, what do you like?

399
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:55,350


400
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,290
Coin toss.

401
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:58,962
AUDIENCE: Heads.

402
00:16:58,962 --> 00:16:59,670
PROFESSOR: Heads.

403
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,930
How'd you do?

404
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,110
Oh Adam, tough break.

405
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,580
Nick again.

406
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,859
Nick is the sole winner.

407
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,880
So he collects on the heads.

408
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,440


409
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:17,119
All right, so it's plus $4
for Nick, minus 2 for Martina,

410
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,880
minus 2 for Adam.

411
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,980
All right, let's see
how they did in total.

412
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,020
Oh, poor Adam.

413
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,940
Minus $6 here.

414
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,800
How did that happen?

415
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,560
Martyna is plus $6.

416
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,570
Now we know how it happened.

417
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:37,655
And Nick is even.

418
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:40,266


419
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:40,766
Even.

420
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:46,950


421
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,050
Yeah, so that's just a
tough break for Adam.

422
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,659
He came up here and lost $6.

423
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:55,700
AUDIENCE: Interestingly,
there's $6 on the table.

424
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,158
I think I should
take that and run.

425
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:57,779
[LAUGHS]

426
00:17:57,779 --> 00:17:59,320
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
you probably should.

427
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,500
But I need to get paid
back from Nick here.

428
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,420
Now obviously this is
a fair game, right?

429
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,760
So how many people think
that Adam was just unlucky?

430
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,010


431
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,010
A few.

432
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,450
How many people think we
just screwed him out of $6?

433
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,000
Yeah, you're right.

434
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,260
But let's do the analysis
to see what happened here.

435
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,156
Meanwhile, I probably
should give him his $6.

436
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:29,060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

437
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,376
PROFESSOR: And you got my money.

438
00:18:31,376 --> 00:18:34,696
All right, so I have
a gift certificate,

439
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,570
if you would like, for
playing the game here.

440
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,450
You can have this or you can
have the pocket protector.

441
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:42,640
I got to say somebody's
last time turned

442
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,670
in this for one of these.

443
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,560
The nerd pride pocket protector.

444
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,700
So what would you
like for your memento?

445
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,408
AUDIENCE: I'm going
to take the box where

446
00:18:51,408 --> 00:18:53,040
[? David Chena ?] is standing.

447
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,820
PROFESSOR: What?

448
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,280
AUDIENCE: As in [INAUDIBLE].

449
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,110
PROFESSOR: You get one
too for tossing the coin.

450
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:03,810
So we'll pass this up.

451
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,310
Here you go.

452
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,010
Want to pass that up
for our coin tosser?

453
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:07,840
OK, very good.

454
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,247
Thanks very much.

455
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:11,330
Just leave the money here.

456
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,377
Yeah.

457
00:19:12,377 --> 00:19:13,210
Leave my money here.

458
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,420
Oh, we took some
out of your wallet.

459
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,076
AUDIENCE: I got $5
money from you-- $5.

460
00:19:16,076 --> 00:19:17,868
PROFESSOR: $5 from me, yeah.

461
00:19:17,868 --> 00:19:19,312
All right, so leave me the $5.

462
00:19:19,312 --> 00:19:21,672
AUDIENCE: This is your $5.

463
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:24,570
PROFESSOR: Oh, I should
give them back their $6.

464
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:26,304
Well, otherwise they
could report me,

465
00:19:26,304 --> 00:19:27,220
and I'd be in trouble.

466
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,450
And it's all on film.

467
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,120
That would not be good.

468
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,990
OK, so what we're going to
do now is analyze the game.

469
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:38,320
And I'm going to
prove to you he was

470
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,520
just unlucky, despite
the fact that you

471
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,830
think I screwed him here.

472
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:46,730
So we're going to analyze
Adam's expected winnings

473
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,910
playing this game.

474
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,840
So let's do that.

475
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,600


476
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,880
So we're going to make
the tree, as usual.

477
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,500
Now, the first thing we
have is Adam's choice.

478
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,467
Now, Adam were you doing
anything besides sort

479
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:03,300
of randomly picking?

480
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,883
Were you trying to
psych out the coin?

481
00:20:04,883 --> 00:20:07,784


482
00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:09,950
AUDIENCE: Apparently I
wouldn't be able to bribe him

483
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,370
from all the way down here.

484
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,280
PROFESSOR: Yeah, and
you did lose most of it.

485
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,870
We'll say Adam
was playing 50-50.

486
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,850
It's a reasonable assumption.

487
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,550
And then we have
Martyna and then

488
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,010
we have Nick and their choices.

489
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,530
And let's say they're 50-50
as well, because none of them

490
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:31,280
know what coin is
going to be tossed.

491
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,571
And I'm not going to draw
this bottom half of the tree,

492
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:35,000
but it's totally symmetric.

493
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,060
It just gets too deep otherwise.

494
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:45,230
And then we have Nick's choices,
heads, tails, heads, tails.

495
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:46,027
And they're 50-50.

496
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:50,342


497
00:20:50,342 --> 00:20:51,425
And then we have the coin.

498
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:53,941


499
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:55,440
And I'll start
drawing it down here.

500
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,197
And the coin can
be heads or tails.

501
00:20:57,197 --> 00:20:59,030
And we're going to
assume it was a fair coin

502
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,780
toss back there, because
it looked like it

503
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,320
was flipping a bunch of times.

504
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,640
And you don't look
like Persi Diaconis,

505
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,240
so we're going to
assume you didn't

506
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,150
learn how to flip heads always.

507
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,118
So those are 50-50.

508
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:13,790


509
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,330
A little tight here.

510
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,370
Everything is 50-50.

511
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:23,040


512
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:27,680
So the probabilities
are all 1/16.

513
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,670
I got 16 possible outcomes.

514
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,330
2 by 2 by 2 by 2.

515
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:34,044
They're all equally likely.

516
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:35,460
So all the
probabilities are 1/16.

517
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:41,970


518
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,380
And now let's see the winnings.

519
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,957
So we'll take Adam's game.

520
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:50,207
It'll turn out to be negative.

521
00:21:50,207 --> 00:21:53,790


522
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:58,440
Now, in this case if Adam's
heads and Martyna and Nick

523
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,990
are heads and the coin comes
up heads, they all win,

524
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,880
they split the pot.

525
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,670
So how much is the gain
for Adam in that case?

526
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:10,630
0.

527
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:14,600
Now they all guessed heads,
but the coin comes out tails,

528
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,720
so they split the pot.

529
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,150
What's Adam's gain there?

530
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,240
0, because they just
split the pot again.

531
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,350
He gets his $2 back.

532
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,010
That's 0.

533
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:29,430
Now we have a case
where Nick is tails,

534
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:33,100
Adam and Martyna were heads,
and it comes out heads.

535
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,870
So Nick is losing here.

536
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,500
The pot is split by
Adam and Martyna.

537
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,540
What does Adam get as a profit?

538
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,040
1.

539
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,290
He gets half the part because
he splits with Martyna.

540
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:49,080
That's $3 he put into,
he gets 1, plus 1.

541
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,710
Now it turns out same
scenario of guesses,

542
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:54,740
but it comes out tails,
so Nick wins everything.

543
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:57,550
What's Adam's status here?

544
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,360
Minus 2.

545
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,800
He bet $2, he lost it.

546
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:07,000
Then we have heads for
Adam, tails for Martyna,

547
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,330
heads for Nick.

548
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:15,550
Coin comes up heads, Adam splits
with Nick, he gets a net of $1.

549
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,300
Same scenario
guesses, but now it's

550
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:22,770
tails, so Martina wins
everything, Adam loses $2.

551
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,180
Now we go down to
here where it's

552
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:28,650
heads for Adam, tails
for Martyna and Nick,

553
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:31,520
and heads comes up, so
Adam wins the whole thing.

554
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,430
What does he get in this case?

555
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,020
Plus 4.

556
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,640
He wins the whole
part of 6 minus 2.

557
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,410
So he gets 4 net.

558
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,690
And then lastly, in this
scenario it comes up tails

559
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,920
and Martina and Nick
split the pot, Adam loses.

560
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,810
Minus 2.

561
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:52,030
And then the same thing
is happening down here.

562
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,860
Same thing.

563
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,800
It's just everything is
reversed by symmetry.

564
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,290
Now, they're all equally likely.

565
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:01,380
So what we do to compute
the expected gain

566
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,290
is take each value times its
probability and add them up.

567
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,420
So 0 times 1/16
plus 0 times 1/16

568
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:12,190
plus 1 times 1/16 minus 2
times 1/16 and so forth.

569
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:15,450
So it's easier just to add
these up and multiply by 1/16.

570
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:18,430
And when we do, we get 0.

571
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,070
We get 0.

572
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,510
If I add all these up, I get 0.

573
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,420
The same thing for down here.

574
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:34,050
So the expected
gain for Adam is 0.

575
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:35,841
And that is a fair game.

576
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:39,320


577
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,746
What do you think?

578
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:42,620
Do you think we'd go to
all that trouble just

579
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,670
to play a fair game?

580
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:46,800
Or do you think we're trying to
set him up and take his money?

581
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,666
Yeah.

582
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:51,890
AUDIENCE: Martyna and
Nick are alternating,

583
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,824
so the branch with
the plus 4 goes away.

584
00:24:53,824 --> 00:24:55,240
PROFESSOR: Oh,
that's interesting.

585
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,396
Look what happened here.

586
00:24:56,396 --> 00:24:59,588


587
00:24:59,588 --> 00:25:09,350
Nick and Martina,
well, they're opposite.

588
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,290
That's opposite.

589
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,090
That's opposite.

590
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:14,180
That's opposite.

591
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,050
You don't suppose they
planned that, do you?

592
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:19,610


593
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:22,620
And how could that possibly
help that they just

594
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,414
happened to guess opposite?

595
00:25:24,414 --> 00:25:25,830
AUDIENCE: One of
them always wins.

596
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,920
PROFESSOR: One of
them always wins.

597
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,956
And what does that
mean for poor Adam?

598
00:25:29,956 --> 00:25:31,580
AUDIENCE: He never
takes the whole pot.

599
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:34,660
PROFESSOR: He never
takes the whole pot.

600
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,430
Well, all right.

601
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:40,050
Let's see if that
changed anything here.

602
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:43,950
So if Nick and
Martyna are always

603
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:48,260
opposite, that means some of
these branches can't occur.

604
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,760
So if Martyna's heads,
Nick is tails, this is out.

605
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,100
So this is happening
with probability 1 now.

606
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:02,210
So these points are at
1/8 each instead of 1/16.

607
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,770
And these go to 0 because
that branch can't happen.

608
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,490
Same thing here.

609
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,290
When you go tails to
Martyna, Nick can't be tails,

610
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:13,110
has to be heads.

611
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:16,590
So these go to 1/8.

612
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,755
These go to 0.

613
00:26:17,755 --> 00:26:21,180


614
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,190
Now, you notice this isn't
working out so well for Adam

615
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:26,830
because we're putting
more weight here

616
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,750
where he's got a net negative
compared to an even situation.

617
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,200
And here he's gone from a
positive situation, that's

618
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,380
getting wiped out
to a net negative.

619
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,960
So let's compute
his probability now.

620
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,480
And I'll get the same
contribution down here.

621
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,760
I've got 1 minus 2 plus 1
of 0 minus 2 is negative 2.

622
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,760
I'll get a negative 2
down here times 1/8.

623
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,080
In this case, I'll
have the expected gain

624
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,330
for Adam is going to be minus.

625
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,270
Let's make sure I do this right.

626
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:09,130
It's going to be 2 for the
top and bottom times 1/8

627
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,560
times these guys.

628
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:17,110
1 minus 2 plus 1 minus 2.

629
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:20,890
And that equals minus 2.

630
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:21,880
That's minus 1/2.

631
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:27,540


632
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:31,600
So in fact, if they come up
here and guess differently,

633
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,330
who knew?

634
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:36,610
Now the expected gain
for Adam is minus $0.50.

635
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:42,420
Every time he plays, he expects
to lose $0.50 on his $2 bet.

636
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,290
That's a lousy game for
Adam to be playing, even

637
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,830
though it seemed very fair.

638
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,680
You see what's going on here?

639
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:58,790
Now, this kind of trick is used
in all sorts of gambling games.

640
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,790
Maybe you've probably
played some of these games

641
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,623
and may not have realized
maybe somebody was

642
00:28:02,623 --> 00:28:05,240
using this trick against you.

643
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,640
For example, how
many of you have

644
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,424
been in some kind of
sports betting pool?

645
00:28:10,424 --> 00:28:11,840
It's March Madness,
you're betting

646
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,350
on the victors in round one.

647
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,180
It's a football pool
for the weekend.

648
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,550
You're going to guess
against the spread.

649
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,341
Who's going to win?

650
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:21,420
All right, some of
you have done that.

651
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,160
All right, now everybody
puts $1 into the pool.

652
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,110
And the winner is the
guy who was the most wins

653
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,330
or games picked right.

654
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:31,240
All the winners split the pot.

655
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,380
Now, what this says, by doing
the same kind of analysis we

656
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:39,430
just did, is that if you
collude with one or two or three

657
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:43,260
other players in the pool
to always pick differently

658
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,170
on all the games, it's
going to give you an edge.

659
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:48,330
Same reasoning.

660
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:51,280
When they pick differently,
it gives them an edge

661
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,580
and now your expected
return is bigger than 0,

662
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:57,080
at the expense of
the other players who

663
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,640
just go in and are
putting their picks, if we

664
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,340
assume each one is 50-50.

665
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,590
In fact, a former professor
of statistics here at MIT

666
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:12,030
used this idea, a guy named
Herman Chernoff, in the 1980s

667
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,190
to beat the state lottery.

668
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,600
Now, everyone knows
that lotteries

669
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,430
are the worst game around
because everybody puts

670
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:24,080
the money in, the
state takes half,

671
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,850
and then the winners
split the pot.

672
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,540
So it's a horrendous game.

673
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,190
Your expected return is
half of what you put in.

674
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,850
So you expect to lose half your
bet, because the state's taking

675
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:38,830
half and splitting the remainder
among all the participants.

676
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:45,170
Now, what Chernoff realized is
that people don't bet randomly.

677
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:49,540
They tend to pick the
same sets of numbers.

678
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,780
It might be a birthday.

679
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,500
There's only so many
birthdays out there.

680
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,660
Might be number of
home runs Papi's hit,

681
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,530
his batting average,
Pabelbon's ERA.

682
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,100
Who knows?

683
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,880
But they pick a
relatively small set

684
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,620
of numbers that
tend to collapse on.

685
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:14,370
In fact, if you graph
how people tend to pick.

686
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,010
And say you're
playing pick four,

687
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,187
where you pick four numbers.

688
00:30:18,187 --> 00:30:20,020
And now you look at the
frequency with which

689
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,690
the numbers are picked.

690
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,090
Very crudely it looks
something like this.

691
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:27,230
Every once in a while
you get a hot ticket

692
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:31,890
where a lot of people
pick that number.

693
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,940
For example, if you're
picking four numbers,

694
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:39,422
MIT students might
pick 2, 4, 6, 16.

695
00:30:39,422 --> 00:30:41,380
They might pick that and
so it'd be a big spike

696
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,070
for that set of four.

697
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:47,274
Down the street they're
probably picking in 1, 2, 3, 4.

698
00:30:47,274 --> 00:30:49,190
Something like that and
there's a spike there.

699
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,280


700
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,550
If you knew this was
the histogram of what

701
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,640
people were picking and
you knew half the pot was

702
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,430
going to get split with the
winners, what would you pick?

703
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,215
Would you pick these?

704
00:31:05,215 --> 00:31:07,590
No, because now you're splitting
the pot with 100 people.

705
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,190
That's no good.

706
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:11,640
You pick down here.

707
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,202
And now when you win,
you get half the pot.

708
00:31:15,202 --> 00:31:17,160
The state always takes
half, but you don't have

709
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,470
to split it with anybody else.

710
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,950
And that means if you're
picking down here,

711
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,820
your expected
return is positive,

712
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,640
even with the state taking half.

713
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:32,330
Because so much of the money
is piled up in these things.

714
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:36,910
And so Chernoff proved
that in fact, he

715
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:39,550
didn't know which
numbers were popular.

716
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,960
He didn't know that.

717
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,009
So what did he do?

718
00:31:42,009 --> 00:31:44,050
If you don't know where
the spikes are but you're

719
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,350
trying to avoid them and
there's not very many spikes,

720
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:49,470
what would you do to avoid them?

721
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,637
Pick random.

722
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:53,970
Because if you pick random,
probably you miss the spike.

723
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,680
You're down here.

724
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
With a number nobody would
have thought to pick,

725
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,430
if some random number.

726
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:02,240
And he showed that, in
fact, if you pick randomly,

727
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,870
your expected gain for
the lottery at the time

728
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,500
was 7%, or $0.7 on the dollar.

729
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,500
So positive even with
the state taking half.

730
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:17,160
Now, shortly after that,
you saw the proliferation

731
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,970
of these random machines that
we create random numbers.

732
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,090
Because the state wanted
to balance it out and not

733
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,310
have this kind of a scenario.

734
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,910
So now a lot of the
picks are randomly

735
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:29,570
generated in a lot
of the lotteries.

736
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,210


737
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,280
These things are not
immediately obvious,

738
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:42,240
but become very clear once you
know the mathematics behind it.

739
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,860
Any questions?

740
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,645
Yeah.

741
00:32:44,645 --> 00:32:47,900
AUDIENCE: How would a
person hit a random number?

742
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,870
PROFESSOR: Oh, you go to
your favorite computer

743
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:52,290
and do a random
number generator.

744
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,490
Now, that's not
perfectly random.

745
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,050
People do get into
a science of this

746
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,512
where they're
certain cosmic rays

747
00:32:58,512 --> 00:33:00,470
or whatever hitting the
earth and the frequency

748
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,136
they try to get random
numbers out of it

749
00:33:02,136 --> 00:33:04,220
or certain kinds
of clocks and stuff

750
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:07,090
like that, the tiny
low order bits.

751
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:10,069
Actually getting really
independent random numbers

752
00:33:10,069 --> 00:33:10,860
can be challenging.

753
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,140
A lot of the things you do
with a computer generating

754
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,140
random numbers, they're
distributed nicely,

755
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,850
but they're not
mutually independent.

756
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:20,250
And there's whole texts
that go into how to do

757
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,385
that for mutual independence.

758
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:24,260
Getting something that's
fair for one of them

759
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,100
is not too hard.

760
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:30,920
Any questions about that?

761
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,970
There's another example.

762
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,920
How many people
ever participated

763
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,090
in a Super Bowl bet?

764
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:40,810
OK, like maybe you're trying to
guess the over under on point

765
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,930
scored.

766
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:47,050
And the person who guesses close
to the total number of points

767
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:48,370
wins the pot.

768
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,760
And if there's a
tie, it's shared.

769
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,490
So in that kind of
situation, some people

770
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,570
figured out that the average
number of points scored

771
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,860
in a Super Bowl is, say, 30.

772
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:07,730
And a lot of the guesses then
will cluster around 30 points.

773
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:10,840
Now, if you knew this and you
knew a lot of the guesses,

774
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,639
because there may be people who
cared betting, where would you

775
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,560
make, say, this is, I don't
know, 40 and this is 20,

776
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,440
where would you guess?

777
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,480
You could guess here.

778
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,120
That's a good one.

779
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,620
Or you could guess here.

780
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:27,448
Not only are you not going to
share the pot, which helps you,

781
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:29,739
but in this case you'd
actually, because being closest,

782
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:32,630
you'd capture all
the scores out here.

783
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,870
So that's really good.

784
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,198
So these are the best guesses to
make for your expected return,

785
00:34:38,198 --> 00:34:40,489
assuming everybody is guessing
around here because they

786
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:41,880
know that's the median.

787
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,846
Yeah?

788
00:34:42,846 --> 00:34:45,384
AUDIENCE: But those scores
aren't likely to happen.

789
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:47,050
PROFESSOR: They're
not likely to happen,

790
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,159
but it can outweigh splitting
the pot with all the people

791
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,870
that guessed here.

792
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:56,744
And you get to cover more bases.

793
00:34:56,744 --> 00:34:58,660
So you're right, they're
less likely to happen

794
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,170
because so many people guessed
in here where it's likely.

795
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,790
Your expected return
is better out here.

796
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,750
You may not be likely
to win, but your payoff

797
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,790
will be very large when you do.

798
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,590
Now, if you're in
a bet or a pool

799
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:17,400
with a bunch of 6042
students and they're all

800
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,542
guessing out here, well then
you want to go back home here.

801
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:23,250
Then it's better.

802
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:28,800
So it all depends on what
that distribution looks like.

803
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,660
All right, any more
questions about this?

804
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,672
Yeah.

805
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,213
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
if you're going

806
00:35:34,213 --> 00:35:35,883
to be playing a
whole bunch of times,

807
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,758
and if you're only
playing once, wouldn't you

808
00:35:37,758 --> 00:35:40,158
look at the most likely result?

809
00:35:40,158 --> 00:35:41,408
PROFESSOR: Say that again now?

810
00:35:41,408 --> 00:35:43,929
AUDIENCE: If you're going to be
only playing once wouldn't you

811
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:45,595
only be concerned
with the result that's

812
00:35:45,595 --> 00:35:47,606
most likely to show up?

813
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:49,480
PROFESSOR: Well, it
depends on your strategy.

814
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,580
If you want the expected
gain to be maximized,

815
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,760
it doesn't matter how
many times you're playing.

816
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,400
And that can be very
different than maximizing

817
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,480
your probability of winning.

818
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,210
If you want to maximize
your probability of winning,

819
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,165
you're going to go right
at the center point here.

820
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,290
Because if you look at the
probability distribution

821
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:12,572
and say the probability
distribution looks like that,

822
00:36:12,572 --> 00:36:14,280
then you want to bet
here, because that's

823
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,390
the maximum chance of winning.

824
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:22,250
But say so many people bet
there, you'd split 30 ways.

825
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:27,260
Well, this divided by 30 is
smaller than this divided by 1.

826
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:31,280
And so your expected return
will be bigger out here.

827
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,500
So two different things.

828
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,160
Maximizing the probability
of winning and maximizing

829
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,830
your expected return.

830
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,394
Yeah?

831
00:36:37,394 --> 00:36:38,810
AUDIENCE: When you
say maximizing,

832
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,144
do you just do derivatives?

833
00:36:41,144 --> 00:36:43,060
PROFESSOR: Yeah, then
you could do derivatives

834
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,840
and all that kind of stuff.

835
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,350
That's right.

836
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,141
Once you have the curve,
you figure it out.

837
00:36:46,141 --> 00:36:47,820
Yeah.

838
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,551
Yeah.

839
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:50,342
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't it
be better to maximize

840
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:56,115
your expected value versus
the probability that you win?

841
00:36:56,115 --> 00:36:56,740
PROFESSOR: Yes.

842
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:01,160
In general, you want to
maximize the expected return

843
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,170
on the basis that
probably over life you're

844
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,950
doing lots of things.

845
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:06,990
And that overall puts
you in a better state.

846
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:09,110
Now, we're going
to talk about this

847
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:14,750
some next time in terms
of taking high risk

848
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,860
bets with high, high payoffs.

849
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,370
That can maximize
your expected return,

850
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,230
but you have a very decent
chance of losing a lot.

851
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,840
And so you might not
want to go there.

852
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,423
And we'll talk about
that next time we

853
00:37:26,423 --> 00:37:29,790
talk about variance and
actually what your choice is.

854
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,110
Because that is a
fundamental choice you face.

855
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:35,760
Maximizing chance of winning,
maximizing expected return.

856
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,970
And of course, tied into
that is the risk of losing

857
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:40,011
and what kind of risk
you're willing to tolerate.

858
00:37:40,011 --> 00:37:43,530


859
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,050
We're going to do a bunch more
examples, but before I do,

860
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,810
I want to show you
some other equivalent

861
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:49,940
definitions of expectation.

862
00:37:49,940 --> 00:38:03,650


863
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:06,150
So the expected value
of a random variable,

864
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:09,290
you can also compute
it by summing over

865
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:12,400
all possible values of
the random variable.

866
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,600
x being in the range of
R. x times the probability

867
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,330
that R equals x.

868
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,200
And let's see why this is true.

869
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,058
It follows from the definition.

870
00:38:24,058 --> 00:38:27,600


871
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,270
From the definition, we
know the expected value

872
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,600
is the sum over
all sample points

873
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,970
of the value of the random
variable on the sample

874
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:37,365
point times its probability.

875
00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:39,970


876
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:46,880
And now we can organize this
sum by the value that R takes.

877
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,480
So we're going to split
this into a double sum

878
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,330
where here we're looking
first at x in the range of R.

879
00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:02,030
And then here we look at
sample points for which R

880
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:04,380
on that point is x.

881
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,220
So this sum is
equivalent to this one.

882
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,970
Here we're just
organizing all the sample

883
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:10,345
points for the same value of x.

884
00:39:10,345 --> 00:39:28,990


885
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:32,430
All right, now in
the inner sum, I've

886
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:36,140
only got values for which
R w equals x, so I can just

887
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,410
replace this with x.

888
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:50,710


889
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,860
The same as before.

890
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,575
Only now I've just
put x instead of Rw.

891
00:39:56,575 --> 00:40:01,750


892
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:05,805
Now I can pull the x out since
it's a constant independent

893
00:40:05,805 --> 00:40:06,670
of that sum.

894
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:23,070


895
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:27,280
Now here I'm summing up the
probability of all the sample

896
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,100
points for which R of
the sample point is x.

897
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:37,890
And that is just the
probability that R equals x.

898
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,540
That's the definition of the
probability of that event.

899
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:44,310
And so now my answer
is some overall values

900
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:48,177
x in the range of x times
of probability R equals x.

901
00:40:48,177 --> 00:40:49,760
And that's what I
was trying to prove.

902
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,870


903
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:00,990
OK, any questions about that?

904
00:41:00,990 --> 00:41:03,230
Now there are some
special cases of this

905
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:07,917
when the random variable
is on the natural numbers.

906
00:41:07,917 --> 00:41:09,625
So the range of R is
the natural numbers.

907
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:21,960


908
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,631
So a corollary.

909
00:41:22,631 --> 00:41:25,400


910
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:33,400
If the random variable has a
range on the natural numbers,

911
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,560
then another way to compute
the expected value of r

912
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:43,640
is to simply sum i equals
1 to infinity i times

913
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,760
the probability R equals i.

914
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,330


915
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:51,190
And the proof, well, it's really
just saying the same thing

916
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,890
here.

917
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,160
I'm just summing over
the natural numbers.

918
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,140
And the case with
0 doesn't matter

919
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:58,830
because I get 0 times
the probability of 0.

920
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:02,390
And that adds
nothing to the sum.

921
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:09,390
So I just have to sum over the
positive integers in that case.

922
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:11,620
All right, there's
another special case

923
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:15,060
of this, which
makes it even easier

924
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,600
sometimes to compute
the expected value.

925
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:39,910


926
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:46,260
If R is a random variable
in the natural numbers,

927
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:50,570
then the expected
value of R is simply

928
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:56,240
the sum i equals 0 to
infinity of the probability

929
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,400
the random variable
is bigger than i.

930
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,755
Which is the same as summing
i equals 1 to infinity,

931
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:09,300
the probability R is
bigger than or equal to i.

932
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,077
They're the same thing.

933
00:43:11,077 --> 00:43:13,160
For example, the first
term here, your probability

934
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,750
R bigger than 0.

935
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:18,510
That's the same as saying R
is bigger than or equal to 1

936
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,220
and so forth.

937
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:22,000
So these are clearly the same.

938
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,760
And the difference
here is we have i times

939
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,230
probability R equals i.

940
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,990
Here we have probability
R is bigger than I,

941
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:32,120
with no i out in front.

942
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,328
So let's see why that's true.

943
00:43:33,328 --> 00:43:57,200


944
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,460
Well, we're going to work
backwards and evaluate

945
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,830
that sum.

946
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:13,350
The sum i equal 0 to infinity
probability R is bigger than i.

947
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:17,250
Well, that's the
probability R is bigger

948
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:21,450
than 0 plus the
probability R is bigger

949
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:27,700
than 1 plus probability
R is bigger than 2,

950
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,133
and so forth out to infinity.

951
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:32,610


952
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:35,340
Adding those up.

953
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:36,910
And now I can
write this one out.

954
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:43,250
That's the probability R
equals 1 plus the probability R

955
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:49,666
equals 2 plus the probability
R equals 3 and so forth.

956
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:52,450


957
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:58,110
Probability are bigger than
1 equals, well, R could be 2,

958
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:03,760
R could be 3, and so forth.

959
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,460
R bigger than 2.

960
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:12,010
Well, R could be
3, 4, and so forth.

961
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:18,110
And so now if I
add all these up,

962
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:23,780
well, I get 1 times
probability R equals 1.

963
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,910
Two of these guys.

964
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:30,810


965
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:32,400
Three of these guys.

966
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,042
And you can see
the pattern here.

967
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:36,970


968
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,810
Before the next and so forth.

969
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:45,150
And so we've shown that this
value equals that value, which

970
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:54,635
is by the corollary just
the expected value of R.

971
00:45:54,635 --> 00:45:57,010
So by the corollary, we know
that the expected value of R

972
00:45:57,010 --> 00:46:00,188
equals the sum up there.

973
00:46:00,188 --> 00:46:01,688
And that's the proof
of the theorem.

974
00:46:01,688 --> 00:46:06,900


975
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:11,280
Sometimes it's easier to use
that top expression there.

976
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,610
And as a good example, it
gives a really easy way

977
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:19,690
to compute the mean time
to failure in a system.

978
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:20,548
So let's do that.

979
00:46:20,548 --> 00:46:30,290


980
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:42,020
Suppose you have a system and
it fails with probability p

981
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:45,210
at each step.

982
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,160
And let's assume
that the failures

983
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,500
are mutually independent.

984
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:53,340
So if the system has
been going for t steps,

985
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:56,700
it still will fail on step
t plus 1 with probability p,

986
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:59,380
no matter what's
happened before.

987
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,950
And the question is, what's
the expected number of steps

988
00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:04,330
before the system fails?

989
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:07,680
How long is it going to
live before you get a crash?

990
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:11,720
And we're going to let R
be that random variable.

991
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:17,000
It will be the step when
failure occurs, first failure.

992
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:25,120


993
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,770
We want to know what's the
expected value of R. Mean time

994
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:29,336
to failure.

995
00:47:29,336 --> 00:47:32,430


996
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:36,350
And we're going to use
that top formula up there.

997
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:38,807
Makes it a lot
simpler to do that

998
00:47:38,807 --> 00:47:39,932
than the other definitions.

999
00:47:39,932 --> 00:47:45,010


1000
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:50,130
Now, the probability
that R is bigger than i

1001
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:53,520
is the same as the
probability it did not

1002
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,396
fail in the first i steps.

1003
00:47:55,396 --> 00:47:58,970


1004
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:08,465
So this equals the probability
of no failure in the first i

1005
00:48:08,465 --> 00:48:08,965
steps.

1006
00:48:08,965 --> 00:48:13,900


1007
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,840
Because this event,
R bigger than i

1008
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,840
means that the first failure
was not in the first steps,

1009
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:23,380
so the system was fine
for the first i steps.

1010
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,970
And because of
mutual independence

1011
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:29,110
on when failure
occurs, this is simply

1012
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:37,140
the product that we're OK,
no failure in the first step

1013
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,600
times the probability.

1014
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:47,800
We're OK in the second step and
so forth up to the ith step.

1015
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,134
We're OK in ith step.

1016
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:52,830


1017
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:55,040
And this is where we're
using mutual independence,

1018
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,420
because I've gone
from a situation where

1019
00:48:57,420 --> 00:48:58,990
we're OK in the first i steps.

1020
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:02,280
The probability of that is the
product of the probabilities.

1021
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,860
We're OK in each
step individually.

1022
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:06,213
So that needed independents.

1023
00:49:06,213 --> 00:49:09,890


1024
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:13,410
Well, what is the probability
we're OK in the first step?

1025
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:17,610


1026
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:21,208
What's the probability of
no failure on step one?

1027
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,950
1 minus p, because p is the
probability we did fail.

1028
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:28,120
So we're OK with
probability 1 minus p.

1029
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,930
What is the probability
we're OK in the second step?

1030
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:39,040
1 minus p and so
forth for all i steps.

1031
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,480
So this is 1 minus p to the eye.

1032
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:48,960
And it's usually simpler to
write that as alpha to the i

1033
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,200
where alpha equals 1 minus p.

1034
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:59,150
Because what we've got
here now is the sum.

1035
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:02,360
Expected value of R
is a sum, i equals 0

1036
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:10,990
to infinity of that probability,
which is just alpha to the i.

1037
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:14,280
And we all know what
that sum is, right?

1038
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,040
What's that sum?

1039
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,430


1040
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:20,985
1 over 1 minus alpha.

1041
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:23,640


1042
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,790
And that plug back in
the alpha to be 1 minus

1043
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:32,702
p is 1 over 1 minus 1 minus p.

1044
00:50:32,702 --> 00:50:33,660
And that's very simple.

1045
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:37,300
That's 1 over p.

1046
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:40,310
So the expected time to
fail, the expected step

1047
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:43,210
of when you're going to
fail, is 1 over p where

1048
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,500
p is the failure probability.

1049
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:50,120
So for example, if you have a 1%
chance of failing on any step,

1050
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:54,510
your mean time to
failure is what?

1051
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,322
100.

1052
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:57,260
1 over 0.01.

1053
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:01,870
So very easy to compute
mean time to failure.

1054
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:06,264
Any questions about that?

1055
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:08,430
Of course, you can do it
with the other definitions,

1056
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:11,660
but the calculations are
a little more painful.

1057
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:12,573
Yeah.

1058
00:51:12,573 --> 00:51:13,906
AUDIENCE: Why are we summing it?

1059
00:51:13,906 --> 00:51:17,250
Is it like an accumulative
solution basically?

1060
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:18,860
PROFESSOR: Why are we summing?

1061
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:20,830
Well, that's the definition.

1062
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:25,930
The theorem says the expected
value of a random variable

1063
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:30,832
is the sum of the probability
that it's bigger than i.

1064
00:51:30,832 --> 00:51:32,040
That's what the theorem says.

1065
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:34,540
So we're just plugging
into the theorem.

1066
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,420
And then the theorem
was proved based

1067
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,020
on the corollary, which came
from the theorem and then

1068
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,129
the definition.

1069
00:51:43,129 --> 00:51:44,670
So we went through
a series of steps.

1070
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:47,510
We started with a definition
of expected value, which

1071
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:48,599
makes sense.

1072
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:50,140
Then we got another
way to compute it

1073
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,181
based on that definition.

1074
00:51:51,181 --> 00:51:53,770


1075
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,782
And then a corollary
to that and then

1076
00:51:56,782 --> 00:51:58,490
we use the corollary
to prove another way

1077
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,710
of computing expected values.

1078
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:01,754
We went through a
bunch of general steps

1079
00:52:01,754 --> 00:52:03,670
and then we used, basically
you could use this

1080
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:06,354
as a definition of this
point for expected value.

1081
00:52:06,354 --> 00:52:08,020
And it just says you
sum those things up

1082
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:08,978
and you get the answer.

1083
00:52:08,978 --> 00:52:12,510


1084
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:13,568
Any other questions?

1085
00:52:13,568 --> 00:52:16,990


1086
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:19,380
OK, there's a variation
on this problem

1087
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:22,890
that you see all the time
in sort of trick questions

1088
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,650
or in the popular
press sometime, that

1089
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,220
often confuses people.

1090
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,630
People sometimes think
of it as a paradox,

1091
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,930
though it's not really one.

1092
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:34,060
And the example's something
like the following.

1093
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:36,610
Say that a couple, they're
going to have kids.

1094
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:38,890
What they really
want is a baby girl.

1095
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,390
They get a boy,
fine, but that's not

1096
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:41,598
what they're concerned about.

1097
00:52:41,598 --> 00:52:43,440
They want to have a baby girl.

1098
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,310
And let's say that
each time they have

1099
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:48,300
a kid it's 50-50 boy or girl.

1100
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,710
And let's say that it's
mutually independent from one

1101
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,380
kid to the next, which
is not true in practice.

1102
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:55,735
There tends to be correlation.

1103
00:52:55,735 --> 00:52:57,860
But let's assume it's
mutually independent from one

1104
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,500
kid to the next.

1105
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:03,750
Now, if on the first
try a couple get a girl,

1106
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,110
great, they're done, they
have one kid, that's it,

1107
00:53:06,110 --> 00:53:07,680
because they just wanted a girl.

1108
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,140
If they get a boy,
OK, try again.

1109
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,890
And they keep trying again
until they get the girl,

1110
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:16,480
even if it's 50 kids.

1111
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,570
They wait till
they get the girl.

1112
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,830
And the question is,
how many baby boys

1113
00:53:21,830 --> 00:53:27,190
do you expect to get
before you have the girl?

1114
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,690
what's?

1115
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:32,461
The expected number of boys to
get the girl, then you quit?

1116
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:37,331
So let's do that.

1117
00:53:37,331 --> 00:53:48,070


1118
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:49,735
So we want to know.

1119
00:53:49,735 --> 00:53:52,690
We have the following data.

1120
00:53:52,690 --> 00:53:57,860
The probability of a boy is 1/2.

1121
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,838
You keep having boys until
you get a girl, then you quit.

1122
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:06,840


1123
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:10,527
We're going to let R
be the random variable

1124
00:54:10,527 --> 00:54:11,485
for the number of boys.

1125
00:54:11,485 --> 00:54:14,050


1126
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:21,290
And everything is mutually
independent from one child

1127
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:23,300
to the next.

1128
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:28,430
How many people think you expect
to have more boys than the one

1129
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:30,330
girl?

1130
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:32,680
You keep having boys
till you get the girl.

1131
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,880
Most people think this.

1132
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:39,390
How many people think you expect
to have fewer than one boy?

1133
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:40,630
Nobody.

1134
00:54:40,630 --> 00:54:43,136
How many people think you
expect to have an equal number?

1135
00:54:43,136 --> 00:54:44,160
Expect one boy.

1136
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,140
Good, OK, so that's the answer.

1137
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,700
In fact, you expect
to have just one boy.

1138
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,859
And the proof, we sort
of just did it here.

1139
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:54,650
Now, in this case,
we're going to set it up

1140
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:56,460
as a mean time to failure.

1141
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:58,480
Same kind of thing.

1142
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,950
Now, in this case the failure
mode, they want the girl,

1143
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:05,640
but that's when you stop,
so that's the failure mode.

1144
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:07,210
And a working step
is you have a boy

1145
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,860
and you keep having the
working steps until you have

1146
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:10,570
failure mode and then you stop.

1147
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:12,630
And in this case,
we're not counting

1148
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:13,610
the step when you stop.

1149
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:19,270
So we know from that that
the expected value of R

1150
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:22,620
is 1 over p, which
is going to be 1/2.

1151
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:26,420
That's the number of
children you have.

1152
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:30,170
And that equals the
mean time to failure.

1153
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:34,250
Minus the girl.

1154
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:37,810
Because you count the girl
as one of the children.

1155
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:40,039
And that's going to be the
expected number of boys.

1156
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:41,580
So number of children
you're expected

1157
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,880
to have minus the girl.

1158
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,770
This is 1 over 1/2.

1159
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:49,115


1160
00:55:49,115 --> 00:55:53,330
And that is 2 minus 1 equals 1.

1161
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:58,770
So you expect to have one
boy before you get the girl.

1162
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:02,930
Any questions on that?

1163
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:06,180
OK, how about this?

1164
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:09,840
Some couples want to have
at least one of each sex.

1165
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:13,530
They want to have at least
one boy and one girl.

1166
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:16,170
So they keep having children
until they get one of each

1167
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:18,170
and then they stop.

1168
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,210
How many children do
they expect to have?

1169
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:25,910


1170
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:27,580
Somebody said two.

1171
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,820
That's a minimum number.

1172
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:34,380
So it's not likely to
be the expected number.

1173
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:35,580
Three.

1174
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,730
Well, OK, who said three?

1175
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:39,030
Why do you think three?

1176
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:42,848
AUDIENCE: Because you have to
have at least the first two,

1177
00:56:42,848 --> 00:56:45,820
so it can be greater than one.

1178
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,302
I mean, one probability
is greater than one child,

1179
00:56:48,302 --> 00:56:50,534
one probability is
greater than two children.

1180
00:56:50,534 --> 00:56:55,080
And after that it's halves
which add up to one.

1181
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,330
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

1182
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,163
That's a good proof.

1183
00:56:57,163 --> 00:56:58,000
Very good.

1184
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,850
That'll work.

1185
00:56:58,850 --> 00:56:59,838
Yeah, yeah.

1186
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:01,421
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about what

1187
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:02,383
you were doing before.

1188
00:57:02,383 --> 00:57:05,429
If you were to switch your
expectations for a girl

1189
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:07,674
and boy, wouldn't it come
out to the same number

1190
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:10,570
but wouldn't it kind
of contradict itself?

1191
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:12,940
PROFESSOR: No, if you stopped
as soon as you had a boy,

1192
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,780
you'd expect to have one
girl before you got a boy.

1193
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:17,057
Totally symmetric.

1194
00:57:17,057 --> 00:57:19,140
In this case, we're stopping
when we get the girl,

1195
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,560
so we expect to have one boy.

1196
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,354
You might have none, you might
have one, you might have two.

1197
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:26,770
and as he mentions, if you put
the probabilities in there,

1198
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,000
they will work
out the right way,

1199
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,291
but we just did it simpler
by the mean time to failure.

1200
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:32,840


1201
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,910
And in fact, there's
also another proof,

1202
00:57:34,910 --> 00:57:37,220
what you're doing.

1203
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,530
Another way to think
about how many kids

1204
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:41,400
you have to get one of each.

1205
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,880
Well you have the first kid.

1206
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,260
And now you have this
problem, because you

1207
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:49,200
want one of the other sex.

1208
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,980
And you keep on trying to
get one of the other sex

1209
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:55,850
and you expect to
have two children

1210
00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:57,090
to get one of the other sex.

1211
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,420
So you have one to start.

1212
00:57:58,420 --> 00:57:59,760
Whatever it is doesn't matter.

1213
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:01,690
And now you expect
to have two more

1214
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,280
until you hit the other sex.

1215
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:05,970
So a total of three is the
expected number of children

1216
00:58:05,970 --> 00:58:10,985
to get one boy and
one girl, at least.

1217
00:58:10,985 --> 00:58:13,314
Any questions about expectation?

1218
00:58:13,314 --> 00:58:15,980


1219
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:22,010
OK, let's do another example.

1220
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:26,120
This comes up all the
time in experimental work.

1221
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:29,540
Probably all of you are going to
have some example at some point

1222
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:33,050
where you're going to
do a problem like this.

1223
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:37,020
And most all the time,
people do it wrong.

1224
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,520
So let's see an example.

1225
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:44,390
Say that you want to measure the
latency of some communications

1226
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:46,410
channel.

1227
00:58:46,410 --> 00:58:49,490
And you want to know
what's the average latency.

1228
00:58:49,490 --> 00:58:52,570
So you set up an experiment.

1229
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,180
You send a package
to the channel,

1230
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:56,740
you measure when it started,
when it got to the other end,

1231
00:58:56,740 --> 00:59:00,900
and you record the answer,
and then you do it 100 times

1232
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,940
and you take the average.

1233
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,270
And you say that's the expected
latency of the channel.

1234
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:10,827
Very, very typical kind of thing
to do, and sometimes OK to do.

1235
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:12,160
So you'd do something like this.

1236
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:15,690
You pick a random
variable D, which

1237
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:23,197
is going to denote the
delay of a packet going

1238
00:59:23,197 --> 00:59:24,030
through the channel.

1239
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:28,560


1240
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,010
And there's, of course,
some underlying distribution

1241
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:35,990
here, which we'll
denote by f of x.

1242
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:38,500
And that's just the
probability that D equals x.

1243
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,510
That's the probability
distribution function.

1244
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:46,450


1245
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:49,120
And as part of doing
your stuff, you

1246
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,110
notice that if I
look at plot f here,

1247
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:58,320
if I look at x on that
axis and f of x here,

1248
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,045
it looks something like this.

1249
01:00:00,045 --> 01:00:02,910


1250
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:05,100
The chance of
getting the observed

1251
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:09,290
cases where I got a long delay
were small, low probability.

1252
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:11,890
And almost all the time
I got a short delay.

1253
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:14,540
So very typically you'll get
a curve that looks something

1254
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,430
like that in terms
of the observations

1255
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:20,600
of your experiment.

1256
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:25,930
And say that you do your
experiment 100 times

1257
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:28,710
and the average latency
was 10 milliseconds.

1258
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:31,887


1259
01:00:31,887 --> 01:00:33,720
And sometimes you want
to be really careful,

1260
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:37,150
so you do the whole thing
again, you do another 100 times.

1261
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:39,190
And maybe it's nine
milliseconds the next time.

1262
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,280
And that sort of
confirms your belief

1263
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,250
that your first
experiment was valid

1264
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,430
and that the expected
latency on this channel

1265
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:48,510
is 10 milliseconds.

1266
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:51,390
Sounds pretty good.

1267
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:53,710
But it can be completely wrong.

1268
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:55,390
And not just because
you're unlucky,

1269
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:57,870
but because you're taking
a simple method like that.

1270
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:04,400
And let me show you an
example where it is way off.

1271
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:14,310


1272
01:01:14,310 --> 01:01:17,210
All right, say you
were just a little more

1273
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:19,350
sophisticated about this.

1274
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:22,010
And when you did
your observations,

1275
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:26,930
you tried to figure out what
this curve really looks like.

1276
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:29,090
And say that you,
looking at the data,

1277
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:33,330
concluded that the probability
that you have a delay of more

1278
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:37,610
than i milliseconds is 1 and i.

1279
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:41,480
That looks like this curve,
as close as anything.

1280
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,234
So from your data,
you conclude this.

1281
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:47,150
That's a little more
sophisticated conclusion,

1282
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:49,300
because now you've
identified what

1283
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,560
you believe the
distribution is, which

1284
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:55,000
is stronger than expectation.

1285
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,754
How would you go about
figuring out the expected value

1286
01:01:58,754 --> 01:01:59,920
if you had that information?

1287
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,800


1288
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,380
I mean, you could average
the 100 sample points.

1289
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:10,550
But is there any way, if you
assume this, what would you

1290
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:14,680
do for the expected value?

1291
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,500
Yeah, did I erase the theorem?

1292
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,870
No, it's over there.

1293
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:22,190
We just plug it to the theorem.

1294
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:23,590
The expected delay
is going to be

1295
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:29,800
the sum of those probabilities
from 1 to infinity.

1296
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,760
So we would compute
from the theorem

1297
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:39,626
the expected delay is i equals
1 to infinity probability.

1298
01:02:39,626 --> 01:02:43,090


1299
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:44,804
Do I want to do the 0 case?

1300
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:46,970
Want to be sure I don't get
caught up in the 0 case.

1301
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:48,560
We'll use the case
1 to infinity.

1302
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,070
Probability D greater
than or equal to i.

1303
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:52,960
So let me put greater
than or equal to here.

1304
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,740


1305
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:02,220
That equals the sum i equals
1 to infinity of 1 over i.

1306
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:03,220
What's that?

1307
01:03:03,220 --> 01:03:07,220


1308
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:11,630
What's the sum of 1 over
i, i from 1 to infinity?

1309
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:13,290
It's infinite.

1310
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,830
Remember those harmonic number?

1311
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:19,120
i going from 1 to n
gives you about log n.

1312
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:22,290
Remember that, the
book stacking thing?

1313
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:28,620
i going from 1 to
infinity, that's infinity.

1314
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:33,070
So in fact, your expected
latency is infinite.

1315
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:35,720
And you just published a paper
saying it was 10 milliseconds,

1316
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,450
maybe nine.

1317
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:41,020


1318
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:43,460
So it's very dangerous to just
take a bunch of the points,

1319
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:47,904
add them up, and average them
and say that is the answer.

1320
01:03:47,904 --> 01:03:49,320
Especially if you
have some reason

1321
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,130
to believe the distribution
looks like this

1322
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:52,671
and it really is
something like that.

1323
01:03:52,671 --> 01:03:54,844
It could be infinite.

1324
01:03:54,844 --> 01:03:57,010
Now in some cases, if your
distribution is very well

1325
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:58,970
behaved, averaging
your sample points

1326
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:01,320
is the perfect thing to do.

1327
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,183
But it helps to know it's not
necessarily the case that's

1328
01:04:05,183 --> 01:04:06,090
a good way to go.

1329
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:09,000


1330
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,518
Any ideas what went wrong?

1331
01:04:10,518 --> 01:04:11,018
Yeah.

1332
01:04:11,018 --> 01:04:12,184
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

1333
01:04:12,184 --> 01:04:14,290
What would be your
probability be over i squared?

1334
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:15,956
PROFESSOR: Yeah, what
would happen then?

1335
01:04:15,956 --> 01:04:19,700
If in fact, it was
1 over i squared.

1336
01:04:19,700 --> 01:04:23,840


1337
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,457
So you need to do this sum.

1338
01:04:26,457 --> 01:04:28,290
Here's a good review
question for the final.

1339
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:30,110
What method do you
use to estimate that?

1340
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:32,770


1341
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:35,360
Remember the how do we do that?

1342
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,540
Is that infinite?

1343
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,580
No.

1344
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:41,250
He used the integration bound.

1345
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:45,072
And you'll see what
this is pretty small.

1346
01:04:45,072 --> 01:04:46,780
It'll be, what, 1 and
a 1/2, 2, something

1347
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:49,660
like that where we can do
the integration method here.

1348
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:51,890
So huge difference.

1349
01:04:51,890 --> 01:04:52,740
This is O of 1.

1350
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:54,190
This is bounded.

1351
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:58,760
Probably less than 2, if we
did the integration method.

1352
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:02,650
So huge difference here
in what the outcome is.

1353
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:07,120
Now, how can it be
that I've got something

1354
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:12,150
with expected infinite value
and I average 100 points

1355
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:14,180
and I got 10 milliseconds?

1356
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:16,130
Yeah.

1357
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:18,130
AUDIENCE: The infinite
value comes from the fact

1358
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,973
that there is a
decent probability

1359
01:05:20,973 --> 01:05:23,228
that delay is going to be huge.

1360
01:05:23,228 --> 01:05:26,306
However, if you only take a
finite number of sample points,

1361
01:05:26,306 --> 01:05:28,828
then chances are
you're not going

1362
01:05:28,828 --> 01:05:30,790
to get any monstrous delays.

1363
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:32,010
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

1364
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:34,670
The chance of seeing anything
beyond 100 milliseconds

1365
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:37,886
is 1 in 100.

1366
01:05:37,886 --> 01:05:39,260
So I'm probably
not going to see.

1367
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:41,530
In a sample size of
100, almost surely

1368
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:46,550
I won't see something that takes
a second, 1,000 milliseconds.

1369
01:05:46,550 --> 01:05:49,470
But yet it's those
rare sample points

1370
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:52,620
that are causing
that sum to blow up.

1371
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:56,150
If I sum that from 1 to
100, I get log of 10.

1372
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:56,742
Pretty small.

1373
01:05:56,742 --> 01:05:59,300


1374
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:04,082
So I get log of 100,
which is pretty small.

1375
01:06:04,082 --> 01:06:06,290
So what's happening when
you do your finite sample is

1376
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:08,950
you're missing
the big guys which

1377
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:12,130
are very rare, but enough
to blow up your expectation.

1378
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,020
Now, you can draw two
conclusions from that.

1379
01:06:15,020 --> 01:06:16,250
One of them is just we did.

1380
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:17,640
The other is,
well, expectation's

1381
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,534
the wrong measure.

1382
01:06:18,534 --> 01:06:19,950
And really what
we should be doing

1383
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:23,939
is looking at only 1,000 sample
points or something like that.

1384
01:06:23,939 --> 01:06:26,230
But in practice of using the
thing over and over again,

1385
01:06:26,230 --> 01:06:28,480
eventually you're going
to get hit with a whopper.

1386
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,630
Sometimes you'll see
people take data points out

1387
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:32,730
when they're really
the big ones.

1388
01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:34,520
They say, oh, well,
that was an anomaly.

1389
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,293
I take that out and then
we compute the average.

1390
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:37,792
Yeah?

1391
01:06:37,792 --> 01:06:39,458
AUDIENCE: How much
would you pay to play

1392
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:43,115
a game where the pair would the
be the latency of the packet?

1393
01:06:43,115 --> 01:06:44,073
PROFESSOR: What's that?

1394
01:06:44,073 --> 01:06:45,614
AUDIENCE: How much
do you pay to play

1395
01:06:45,614 --> 01:06:48,080
a game where the pair would
be the latency of the packet?

1396
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:48,955
PROFESSOR: All right.

1397
01:06:48,955 --> 01:06:51,720


1398
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,810
That's a big number.

1399
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:57,170
If that was my losses
here, that's tough.

1400
01:06:57,170 --> 01:07:00,500
I'd bet anything
up against that.

1401
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:02,730
To get a payoff of infinity?

1402
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:05,260
You'd pay $1,000
to play that game.

1403
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:08,040
Now, you'd want to
play it for a long time

1404
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:11,050
to get that big payoff, right?

1405
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:13,420
But eventually that's
what it's going to be.

1406
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:19,260


1407
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:19,860
Any questions?

1408
01:07:19,860 --> 01:07:23,040
People understand the
issue here and what

1409
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,650
to worry about when you
all do that someday?

1410
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:26,234
Yeah.

1411
01:07:26,234 --> 01:07:27,150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1412
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:33,350


1413
01:07:33,350 --> 01:07:36,100
PROFESSOR: Yeah, now here
you don't know for a fact

1414
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:36,600
this is it.

1415
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,640
But you could model and
you start seeing these.

1416
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:42,160
You fill in the points and
you say, it looks like this,

1417
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,304
let's assume that's what it
was, then here's the result.

1418
01:07:45,304 --> 01:07:47,470
If it looks like it's 1
over i squared, you can say,

1419
01:07:47,470 --> 01:07:49,700
let's assume that's what
it is and then you get

1420
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:53,050
a different result. But
you take the various cases

1421
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:55,210
and consider them to do it.

1422
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:59,200
Or you could say, I take the
expectation assuming I never

1423
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:02,270
get a point bigger than 100.

1424
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:03,540
And I limit it that way.

1425
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:05,242
And then you're
safe at that point

1426
01:08:05,242 --> 01:08:06,450
and you can get away with it.

1427
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,241
But to blindly go out
there and say here it

1428
01:08:08,241 --> 01:08:10,113
is, not so reliable.

1429
01:08:10,113 --> 01:08:16,359


1430
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:20,410
The expected value does have
a lot of useful properties.

1431
01:08:20,410 --> 01:08:25,510
And the most important is
called linearity of expectation.

1432
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:27,863
And we'll spend the rest of
today and some of next time

1433
01:08:27,863 --> 01:08:28,571
talking about it.

1434
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:32,229


1435
01:08:32,229 --> 01:08:34,910
And quite possibly it's
one of the reasons people

1436
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,899
use it so much instead of other
things you might think about.

1437
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:53,020


1438
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:55,319
The theorem, and this may be
the most important theorem

1439
01:08:55,319 --> 01:08:55,973
on probability.

1440
01:08:55,973 --> 01:08:58,810


1441
01:08:58,810 --> 01:09:13,420
For any random variables, R1 and
R2, on a probability space S,

1442
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:21,890
the expected value of R1 plus R2
equals the expected value of R1

1443
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:26,290
plus the expected value of R2.

1444
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:27,547
Very simple.

1445
01:09:27,547 --> 01:09:29,130
It's another way of
saying expectation

1446
01:09:29,130 --> 01:09:32,080
is a linear function.

1447
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:32,579
The proof.

1448
01:09:32,579 --> 01:09:37,109


1449
01:09:37,109 --> 01:09:38,330
No, skip the proof here.

1450
01:09:38,330 --> 01:09:39,981
It's not hard and
it's in the text.

1451
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:43,760


1452
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,864
Follows pretty simply
from the definition.

1453
01:09:45,864 --> 01:09:53,250


1454
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:57,067
There's a generalization for
more than two random variables.

1455
01:09:57,067 --> 01:09:59,810


1456
01:09:59,810 --> 01:10:00,997
So corollary.

1457
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:03,990


1458
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:12,390
For all k in the natural numbers
and k random variables R1,

1459
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:18,920
R2, up to Rk on the
sample probability space

1460
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:28,090
S. The expected value of
R1 plus R2 plus Rk is just

1461
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:29,465
the sum of the expected values.

1462
01:10:29,465 --> 01:10:36,220


1463
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:40,212
And the proof of that is by
induction using that result.

1464
01:10:40,212 --> 01:10:41,920
And the really important
thing about this

1465
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:44,430
is that neither of these
results needs independence.

1466
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:47,370


1467
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:52,764
It is true whether or not
the Ri are independent.

1468
01:10:52,764 --> 01:10:58,850


1469
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:01,190
Pretty much everything
we do in probability

1470
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:04,530
to manipulate random variables
needs them to be independent.

1471
01:11:04,530 --> 01:11:06,050
You don't need that here.

1472
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:08,412
And that'll make
it very powerful.

1473
01:11:08,412 --> 01:11:09,370
So let's do an example.

1474
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:28,370


1475
01:11:28,370 --> 01:11:32,446
Say I roll two fair dice.

1476
01:11:32,446 --> 01:11:35,780


1477
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:36,720
Six sided dice.

1478
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:42,320


1479
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:45,360
Not necessarily independent.

1480
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,730
R1 is the outcome
on the first die.

1481
01:11:48,730 --> 01:11:53,990


1482
01:11:53,990 --> 01:12:00,740
And R2 will be the
outcome on the second one.

1483
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:04,680
And I'm interested in
the sum of the dice.

1484
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:08,470
So with that R
it'd be R1 plus R2.

1485
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:12,062
And I want to know the expected
value of the sum of the dice

1486
01:12:12,062 --> 01:12:12,770
when I roll them.

1487
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:16,280


1488
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:20,260
Now, if I didn't
use that theorem

1489
01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:22,740
I'd compute the tree
in the sample space.

1490
01:12:22,740 --> 01:12:27,360
I'd get 36 possible outcomes,
take the probability of each.

1491
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,210
It'd take you a
little while to do it,

1492
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:33,320
but using linearity of
expectation, it's easy.

1493
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:38,070
It's expected value of R1
plus the expected value of R2.

1494
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:43,230
Each of these we already
figured out is 3 and 1/2.

1495
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:46,330
And so the answer is 7.

1496
01:12:46,330 --> 01:12:49,170
So if you roll a pair
of dice, whether or not

1497
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:52,721
they are independent, the
expected sum is seven.

1498
01:12:52,721 --> 01:12:55,370


1499
01:12:55,370 --> 01:12:59,270
Any questions about
linearity of expectation?

1500
01:12:59,270 --> 01:13:00,122
Yeah.

1501
01:13:00,122 --> 01:13:01,038
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1502
01:13:01,038 --> 01:13:08,750


1503
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:10,550
PROFESSOR: This one?

1504
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:11,334
[INAUDIBLE]

1505
01:13:11,334 --> 01:13:12,250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

1506
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,950


1507
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:16,530
PROFESSOR: No, I
mean pluses here.

1508
01:13:16,530 --> 01:13:18,230
Here?

1509
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:20,413
I'm computing the sum
of the random variables.

1510
01:13:20,413 --> 01:13:23,180


1511
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:27,180
So this could be a 1, that could
be a 10, this could be a 3.

1512
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:29,610
So I'm compute the
expected value of the sum,

1513
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,770
just like when I
rolled two, dice I'm

1514
01:13:31,770 --> 01:13:36,328
taking the expected value
of the sum of the dice.

1515
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:37,161
Any other questions?

1516
01:13:37,161 --> 01:13:43,850


1517
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:47,610
Now we're going to do a
little trickier problem that

1518
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:49,562
uses linearity of expectation.

1519
01:13:49,562 --> 01:13:53,250


1520
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:54,970
Yeah?

1521
01:13:54,970 --> 01:13:57,940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
sets, like when

1522
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:01,845
we're looking at the failure.

1523
01:14:01,845 --> 01:14:06,208
Couldn't we add the two
cases, like R1 being

1524
01:14:06,208 --> 01:14:08,650
a girl and R2 being a boy?

1525
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:14,924
PROFESSOR: Well, what
would it mean to sum-- so

1526
01:14:14,924 --> 01:14:16,090
what is the random variable?

1527
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:17,820
R1 is the case
when you get a boy.

1528
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,940
So it's an indicator
for getting a boy.

1529
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:22,790
R2 is the indicator
for getting a girl.

1530
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:25,310
R1 plus R2 is by
definition 1 then,

1531
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:26,760
because you got a boy or a girl.

1532
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,330
One of them had to happen.

1533
01:14:28,330 --> 01:14:29,920
And the expected
value would be one,

1534
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,690
But that's a different
kind of game.

1535
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:36,440
But we are going to start using
this in sophisticated ways

1536
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:39,305
to make calculations be
easier for things like that.

1537
01:14:39,305 --> 01:14:43,680


1538
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:44,180
so

1539
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,230
This problem we call
the hat check problem.

1540
01:14:46,230 --> 01:14:51,560


1541
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:54,250
And the idea here
behind this is say

1542
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:59,350
that you have n men at a
restaurant having dinner.

1543
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:01,110
And when they come
into the restaurant,

1544
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:04,360
they check their hats
in the coat room.

1545
01:15:04,360 --> 01:15:06,790
Then something goes
wrong in the coat room

1546
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:10,200
and the hats are all
scrambled up randomly.

1547
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:13,010
Let's say a random
permutation of the hats.

1548
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:15,480
So the men come back
to get their hats

1549
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:19,370
and they get a random
hat coming back.

1550
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:31,220
So each man gets a random
hat back after dinner.

1551
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:35,520
And the question is, what is
the expected number of men

1552
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,331
to get the right hat back?

1553
01:15:37,331 --> 01:15:39,980


1554
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:41,840
So we let R be the
random variable

1555
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,590
that says the
number of men to get

1556
01:15:45,590 --> 01:15:49,162
the right hat, their happen.

1557
01:15:49,162 --> 01:15:52,000


1558
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:57,140
And we want to know the
expected value of R.

1559
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:58,850
Now, from the
definition, that's just

1560
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:01,570
the sum of all possibilities.

1561
01:16:01,570 --> 01:16:04,556
K from 1 to n.

1562
01:16:04,556 --> 01:16:09,100
K times the
probability R equals k.

1563
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:12,330
So using one of
the definitions, we

1564
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:14,310
could compute the
expected value this way.

1565
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:17,820
In fact, if you were to
be assigned this on a test

1566
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,770
or on homework, that's
probably how you'd

1567
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:21,010
start something like that.

1568
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:23,560


1569
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,994
And then, well, the
next step you'd take

1570
01:16:25,994 --> 01:16:28,410
would be to figure out what's
the probability that exactly

1571
01:16:28,410 --> 01:16:32,980
K men get the right hat back.

1572
01:16:32,980 --> 01:16:35,280
In fact, we actually
asked this once before we

1573
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,430
started doing it in class.

1574
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:40,170
And it was really hard if
you went down this path.

1575
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:44,230
Because if you spent all
night with your buddies,

1576
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:46,780
you would maybe get
to the conclusion

1577
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:52,330
that probability R
equals K is this.

1578
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:59,800
1 over K factorial times n minus
K down here for K less than

1579
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,680
or equal to n minus 2.

1580
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:10,130
And 1 over n factorial if
K equals n minus 1 or n.

1581
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:14,590
Then you would plug that nasty
looking thing into there.

1582
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:18,330
So multiply by K. And
you'd have to sum it up.

1583
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:19,780
And Lord help you.

1584
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:22,000
That's just a nightmare to do.

1585
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,640
You'd have a very hard
time getting the answer.

1586
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,980
If you doubt that, try it.

1587
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:29,964
But that would be a
natural way to proceed.

1588
01:17:29,964 --> 01:17:32,790


1589
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:35,430
But it turns out there is a
trivial way to get the answer.

1590
01:17:35,430 --> 01:17:37,940
And this is a very
powerful technique

1591
01:17:37,940 --> 01:17:40,200
using linearity of expectation.

1592
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:43,590
And for sure there will be a
problem on the final exam just

1593
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:45,790
like this.

1594
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:49,620
And so if you go down this path,
which is a natural first path,

1595
01:17:49,620 --> 01:17:53,630
it may take you the rest
of the day to solve it.

1596
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:55,130
But the method I'm
going to show you

1597
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:57,407
will take you a couple
minutes to do it.

1598
01:17:57,407 --> 01:18:02,370


1599
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:05,070
Now, the trick is to use
linearity of expectations.

1600
01:18:05,070 --> 01:18:09,610
So the problem is
there's no sum here.

1601
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:11,960
So what we need to do is
we're going to express R

1602
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:16,300
as the sum of random variables.

1603
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:22,740
And the way we're going
to do that is as follows.

1604
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,540
And it's not obvious,
but once you see it,

1605
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:26,094
it's easy to keep using it.

1606
01:18:26,094 --> 01:18:28,700


1607
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:35,825
We let R be the sum
of R1 plus R2 plus Rn.

1608
01:18:35,825 --> 01:18:40,075
And Ri is going to
tell us the event.

1609
01:18:40,075 --> 01:18:42,570
This is sort of what
you were talking

1610
01:18:42,570 --> 01:18:45,170
about before with the event
of a boy or event of a girl.

1611
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:47,580
This is going to be the
event of the ith man

1612
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:50,830
gets his right hat back.

1613
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:52,710
So it's an indicator
random variable.

1614
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:59,610
It's 1 if the ith man
gets the right hat.

1615
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:02,170


1616
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,110
And it's 0 if he doesn't.

1617
01:19:04,110 --> 01:19:10,060


1618
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:14,700
So whenever the ith guy gets his
hat back, that counts as one,

1619
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:17,095
and now you can see
why this sum works.

1620
01:19:17,095 --> 01:19:21,110
R is the number of men to
get the right hat back.

1621
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:24,210
And it basically there's a
one counted in here every time

1622
01:19:24,210 --> 01:19:28,740
a guy gets his hat back,
and 0 if he doesn't.

1623
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:33,276
So this sum is counting how many
men got their right hat back.

1624
01:19:33,276 --> 01:19:36,280


1625
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:38,980
Non-obvious the first
time, gets really simple

1626
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:41,420
the fourth or fifth time.

1627
01:19:41,420 --> 01:19:43,896
We'll try to do a
couple of them today.

1628
01:19:43,896 --> 01:19:48,290


1629
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:52,505
All right, now the expected
value of R is easy.

1630
01:19:52,505 --> 01:19:55,230


1631
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:57,270
It's just by linearity
of expectation,

1632
01:19:57,270 --> 01:20:00,590
expected value of
R1 and so forth

1633
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:01,890
plus the expected value of Rn.

1634
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:05,310


1635
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:10,150
The expected value of an
indicator random variable

1636
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:13,350
is just the probability
that it's 1.

1637
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,040
Right it's 1 times
the probability,

1638
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:17,484
it's 0 times the
probability of 0.

1639
01:20:17,484 --> 01:20:19,150
That's just the
probability that it's 1.

1640
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:28,650


1641
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:31,680
What's the probability that the
first man gets the right hat

1642
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,400
back?

1643
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,080
1 over n.

1644
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:35,730
There's n hats.

1645
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:38,820
He gets a random one.

1646
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:41,607
What's the probability that the
second man gets his hat back?

1647
01:20:41,607 --> 01:20:44,870


1648
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:47,980
Not 1 over n minus 1.

1649
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:50,760
He's coming in whether he's
first, second, or last.

1650
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,630
He gets a random hat.

1651
01:20:53,630 --> 01:20:55,310
1 in n chance it's his.

1652
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:59,340


1653
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:04,660
What's the probability the last
man gets the right hat back?

1654
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:05,200
One over n.

1655
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,033
Doesn't really matter
if he's first or last.

1656
01:21:07,033 --> 01:21:09,030
Just sort of tricks
up a little bit.

1657
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,480
He's getting a random hat back.

1658
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,470
So it's 1 over n.

1659
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:15,330


1660
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:17,880
I got n of each, 1
over n, so what's

1661
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,170
the expected number of men
to get the right hat back?

1662
01:21:21,170 --> 01:21:23,290
One.

1663
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:26,680
Now, the math doesn't get
much easier than that.

1664
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,480
Now, the amazing
thing is we just

1665
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:34,730
proved that if we take
that mess, stick it in here

1666
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:38,610
and sum it up, what
answer do we get?

1667
01:21:38,610 --> 01:21:39,900
1.

1668
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:42,310
That is certainly not obvious,
but that is a consequence

1669
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:44,240
of everything we've just done.

1670
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,560
We've just given a probability
proof of that fact.

1671
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:50,170
But the nice thing here
is there's actually

1672
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:52,920
even more powerful.

1673
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:56,870
Did I need to assume that it
was a random permutation of hats

1674
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,600
like I would need
to assume for this?

1675
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:03,180


1676
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:06,040
No independence is needed.

1677
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:09,350
In fact, there's all sorts
of distributions that will

1678
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:11,140
give the same expected value.

1679
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:14,220
All I need is that each
person gets the right hat back

1680
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:17,246
with probability 1 over n.

1681
01:22:17,246 --> 01:22:19,960
In fact, this is an example
of a different distribution

1682
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:22,390
for which the
result is the same.

1683
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:24,459
Say you're at a
Chinese restaurant.

1684
01:22:24,459 --> 01:22:26,250
And you know they have
the thing that spins

1685
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:28,640
in the middle of the table?

1686
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,380
Say that you each
order an appetizer.

1687
01:22:30,380 --> 01:22:32,850
There's n people and they're
around a big circular table.

1688
01:22:32,850 --> 01:22:35,110
Everybody gets their appetizer.

1689
01:22:35,110 --> 01:22:36,930
Wonton soup, whatever.

1690
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:40,540
And then there's always the
joker who spins the thing

1691
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:44,560
and spins around
and then it stops

1692
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,480
and now you've got a random
appetizer in front of you.

1693
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:50,930
In this case, we
want to know what's

1694
01:22:50,930 --> 01:22:53,920
the expected number of people
to get the right appetizer back.

1695
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:58,460
Not the other guys
wonton soup, but yours.

1696
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:00,120
That's a different
probability space

1697
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:02,362
because there's only n
sample points, n places where

1698
01:23:02,362 --> 01:23:03,570
the thing could have stopped.

1699
01:23:03,570 --> 01:23:08,390
Not n factorial like the hats.

1700
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:12,670
Well, does the analysis change?

1701
01:23:12,670 --> 01:23:14,660
Exactly the same.

1702
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:17,320
Ri is the indicator
variable for the ith person

1703
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:20,200
gets the right appetizer back.

1704
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,650
Linearity of expectation.

1705
01:23:22,650 --> 01:23:24,580
The expected value of
the indicator variable

1706
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:26,750
is just the probability
that it's 1.

1707
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:28,210
And the probability
that any person

1708
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:31,010
gets the right
appetizer is 1 over n.

1709
01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:32,150
So the answer is the same.

1710
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:34,483
The expected number of people
to get the right appetizer

1711
01:23:34,483 --> 01:23:36,400
back is 1.

1712
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:40,130
So totally different
probability spaces, exactly

1713
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:43,840
the same analysis and answer.

1714
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:47,260
OK, so we'll do more
of this next time.

1715
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:53,086
