00:00:18,162 --> 00:00:23,160


10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,370
PROFESSOR: Just a reminder,
drop day is tomorrow.

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,415
So if you were thinking
about dropping the course

12
00:00:27,415 --> 00:00:29,960
or in danger of a bad
grade or something,

13
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,420
tomorrow's the last
chance to bail out.

14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,660
Last time we began our
discussion on probability

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,440
with the Monty Hall game--
the Monty Hall problem.

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,280
And as part of the analysis,
we made assumptions

17
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,580
of the form that given that
Carol placed the prize in box

18
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:52,440
1, the probability that
the contestant chooses

19
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,280
box 1 is 1/3.

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,620
Now, this is an
example of something

21
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,589
that's called a
conditional probability.

22
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:02,380
And that's what we're
going to study today.

23
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:13,930


24
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,170
Now, in general,
you have something

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,950
like the conditional
probability that an event, A,

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:24,210
happens given that some
other event, B, has already

27
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,770
taken place.

28
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:38,650
And you write that down as
a probability of A given B.

29
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,945
And both A and B are events.

30
00:01:39,945 --> 00:01:44,190


31
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,665
Now, the example
from Monty Hall--

32
00:01:46,665 --> 00:01:48,870
and actually, we had
several-- but you

33
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:56,230
might have B being
the event that Carol

34
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:59,670
places the prize in box 1.

35
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,820


36
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:17,300
And A might be the event that
the contestant chooses box 1.

37
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,200
And we assumed for
the Monty Hall game

38
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:29,200
that the probability of
A given B in this case

39
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,110
was 1/3 third because
the contestant didn't

40
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,220
know where the prize was.

41
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,960


42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,320
Now in general, there's
a very simple formula

43
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,974
to compute the probability
of A given B. In fact, we'll

44
00:02:44,974 --> 00:02:46,015
treat it as a definition.

45
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:48,920


46
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:55,700
Assuming the probability of B
is non-zero than the probability

47
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:03,440
of A given B is just the
probability of A and B

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,860
happening, both happening,
divided by the probability

49
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,700
of B happening.

50
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,620
And you can see why this makes
sense when the picture-- say

51
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,560
this is our sample space.

52
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,370
And let this be the
event, A, and this

53
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:28,440
be the event, B. Now we're
conditioning on the fact

54
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,110
that B happened.

55
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:33,360
Now once we've
conditioned on that,

56
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,320
all this stuff outside of
B is no longer possible.

57
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,930
All those outcomes are no longer
in the space of consideration.

58
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:45,850
The only outcomes left
are in B. So in some sense

59
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,050
we've shrunk the
sample space to be B.

60
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:52,660
And all we care about is the
probability that A happens

61
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,410
inside this new sample space.

62
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,950
And that is, we're asking the
probability 1 of these outcomes

63
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,040
happens given that this
is the sample space.

64
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,160
Well, this is just A
intersect B because you still

65
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,650
have to have A happen, but
now you're inside of B.

66
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:13,530
And then we divide
by probability of B.

67
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,150
So we normalize this
to be probability one.

68
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:17,649
OK.

69
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,490
Because we're
saying B happened--

70
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,970
we're conditioning on that.

71
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,680
Therefore, the probability
of these outcomes must be 1.

72
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:28,660
So we divide by the probability
of B. So we normalize.

73
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,290
This now becomes-- the
probability of A given B

74
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,310
is this share of B
weighted by the outcomes.

75
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,810
OK.

76
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,020


77
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,520
All right.

78
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,410
For example then, what's the
probability of B given B?

79
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:47,970


80
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,740
what's that equal?

81
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,700
1.

82
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,470
OK.

83
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,406
Because we said it happened-- so
it happens with probability 1.

84
00:04:54,406 --> 00:04:58,890
Or, using the formula, that's
just probability of B and B

85
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,890
divided by probability
of B. Well, that

86
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,470
equals the probability
of B divided

87
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:09,511
by the probability
of B, which is 1.

88
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:10,010
All right.

89
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,010
Any questions about
the definition

90
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,970
of the conditional probability?

91
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:16,500
Very simple.

92
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,130
And it's easy to work
with using the formulas.

93
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,850
Now, there's a nice
rule called the product

94
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:25,635
rule, which follows from
the definition very simply.

95
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:31,600


96
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,450
The product rule says that
the probability of A and B

97
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:40,290
for two events is equal
to the probability of B

98
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:44,880
times the probability
of A given B.

99
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,060
And that's just follow
straightforwardly

100
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,700
from this definition.

101
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,750
Just multiply by probability
of B on both sides.

102
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,250
All right.

103
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,708
So now you have a
rule of computing

104
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:59,750
a probability of two events
simultaneously happening.

105
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,460
So for example, in the
Monty Hall problem,

106
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,190
what's the probability
that Carol places

107
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:11,840
the prize in box one and that's
the box the contestant chooses?

108
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,340
All right?

109
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,650
So if we took A and B
as defined up there,

110
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,880
that's the probability that
Carol places it in box one

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,090
and the contestant chose it.

112
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:24,500
Well, that's the probability
that the contestant chooses

113
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,740
it is 1/3 times the probability
that Carol put it there,

114
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,130
given the contestant chose
it, or actually, vice versa,

115
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,282
Is 1/9.

116
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:38,430
OK?

117
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,275
And this extends to more events.

118
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,870


119
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,830
It is called the
general product rule.

120
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:55,500


121
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:02,170
So if you want to compute
the probability of A1 and A2

122
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:08,840
and all the way up to An, that's
simply the probability of a 1

123
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:17,760
happening all by itself times
the probability of A2 given A1

124
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,350
times-- well, I'll do the next
one-- times the probability

125
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:29,750
of A3 given A1 and A2, dot,
dot dot, times, finally,

126
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,940
the probability of An
given all the others.

127
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:40,730


128
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,360
So that starts to look a
little more complicated.

129
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,720
But it gives you a handy way
of computing the probability

130
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,565
that an intersection
of events takes place.

131
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:51,080


132
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,639
I do This is proved by induction
on n, just taking that rule

133
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,680
and using induction on n.

134
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,690
It's not hard.

135
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,810
But we won't go through it.

136
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,310
All right.

137
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,770
Let's do some examples.

138
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,070
We'll start with an easy one.

139
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:07,750


140
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,670
Say you're playing
a playoff series

141
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,430
and you're going to
play best 2 out of 3.

142
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,358
All right.

143
00:08:15,358 --> 00:08:22,210
So you have a best
2 out of 3 series.

144
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,350
So whoever wins the first two
games, best two out of three

145
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,590
wins.

146
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,210
And say you're told that
the probability of winning

147
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,570
the first game is 1/2.

148
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:44,450


149
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:48,560
So the teams are matched
50-50 for the first game.

150
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,020
But then you're told that the
probability of winning a game

151
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,590
after a victory is higher.

152
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,165
It's 2/3.

153
00:08:56,165 --> 00:09:02,000


154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:09,700
So the probability of
winning immediately

155
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:22,190
after a game following
a win is two thirds.

156
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,540
And similarly, the probability
of winning after a loss is 1/3.

157
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:43,370


158
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:43,870
All right.

159
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,000
And the idea here is
that you win a game,

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,860
you're sort of psyched,
you've got momentum,

161
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,870
and going into the next day
you're more likely to win.

162
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,730
Similarly, if you lost
you're sort of down

163
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,250
and the other guy has a
better chance of beating you.

164
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,630
Now, what we're going
to try to figure out

165
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,940
is the probability
of winning the series

166
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,450
given you won the first game.

167
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:05,950
All right?

168
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,100
Now, conditional
probability comes up

169
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,540
in two places in this problem.

170
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,720
Anybody tell me places
where it's come up?

171
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,970
So I got the problem statement
and the that's the goal

172
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,870
is to figure out the probability
you win the series given

173
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,828
you won the first game.

174
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:21,030
So what's one place
conditional probability

175
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:24,880
is entering into this problem?

176
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,140
Yeah?

177
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,550
AUDIENCE: The
probability changes

178
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:31,252
depending on the result
of the previous game.

179
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:32,210
PROFESSOR: That's true.

180
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,270
The probability of winning
any particular game

181
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,910
is influenced by
the previous game.

182
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,780
So you're using conditional
probability there.

183
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,140
All right.

184
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,860
And where else?

185
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,546
Yeah.

186
00:10:42,546 --> 00:10:46,434
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
you have to take

187
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:48,100
into account [INAUDIBLE].

188
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,350
PROFESSOR: That's interesting.

189
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,558
That will be another question
we're going to look at.

190
00:10:51,558 --> 00:10:54,050
What's the probability
of playing three games?

191
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,340
Yep.

192
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,521
That's one.

193
00:10:57,521 --> 00:10:58,020
OK.

194
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,410
Well, the question
we're after, what's

195
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,310
the probability of
winning the series given

196
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,040
that you won the first game.

197
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,040
We're going to compute a
conditional probability there.

198
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,954
So it's coming up in a
couple of places here.

199
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:10,870
All right.

200
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,650
Let's figure this out.

201
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:16,710
It's easy to do given
the tree method.

202
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,610
So let's make the tree for this.

203
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:27,300
So we have possibly three games
there's game one, game two,

204
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,190
and game three.

205
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:31,060


206
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,910
Game one, you can win or lose.

207
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:36,560
There's two branches.

208
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,135
Game two you can win or lose.

209
00:11:38,135 --> 00:11:41,350


210
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:46,650
And now, game three-- well, it
doesn't even take place here.

211
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:47,450
But it does here.

212
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,800
You can win or lose here.

213
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,520
And you could win or lose here.

214
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,120
And here the series is over.

215
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,040
So there is no game
three in that case.

216
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,030
The probabilities are
next we put a probability

217
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,900
of every branch here.

218
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,820
Game one is 50-50.

219
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,207


220
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:10,040
What's the probability
you take this branch?

221
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,530


222
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,170
2/3, because you're on the path
where you won the first game.

223
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,760
You win the second
game with 2/3.

224
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,540
You lose with 1/3.

225
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,020
Now here you're on the path
where you lost the first game.

226
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,931
So this has 1/3
and this has 2/3.

227
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:30,430
All right?

228
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,510
And then lastly, what's
the probability I have

229
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:39,060
the win on the third game here?

230
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,150
1/3, because I just
lost the last game.

231
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,220
That's all I'm conditioning on.

232
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,250
So that becomes 1/3.

233
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,150
And this is 2/3 now.

234
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,770
And then here I just won a game.

235
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,386
So I've got 2/3 and 1/3.

236
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:55,290
All right.

237
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:57,890
So I got all the probabilities.

238
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:02,870
And now I need to figure out
for the sample points what's

239
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,730
their probability.

240
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,760
So this sample point
we'll call win-win.

241
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,176
This sample point
is win-lose-win.

242
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:15,089


243
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:16,130
This one's win-lose-lose.

244
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,130


245
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:27,780
Then we have lose-win-win,
lose-win-lose,

246
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,040
and then lose-lose.

247
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,010
So I got six sample points.

248
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,430
And let's figure out the
probability for each one.

249
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,280
Now remember the rule we
had for the tree method.

250
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,570
I just multiply these things.

251
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,820
Well, in fact, the
reason we have that rule

252
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,120
is because that is the
same as the product rule.

253
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,830
Because what I'm
asking here to compute

254
00:13:50,830 --> 00:14:03,210
the probability of this guy
is-- so the product rule gives

255
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:07,700
the probability of a win-win
scenario-- win the first game,

256
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,420
win the second game.

257
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,210
By the product rule
is the probability

258
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:16,580
that I win the first game
times the probability

259
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:23,570
that I win the second game
given that I won the first game.

260
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,280
That's what the
product rule says.

261
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,590
Probability I win the
first game is 1/2 times

262
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,480
the probability I
win the second given

263
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,590
that I won the first is 2/3.

264
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,270
So that equals 1/3.

265
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,641


266
00:14:45,641 --> 00:14:47,390
So what we're doing
here now is giving you

267
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:51,270
the formal justification for
that rule that we had last time

268
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,770
and that you'll always use--
is the probability of a sample

269
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,320
point is the product
of the probabilities

270
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,100
on the edges leading to it.

271
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,310
It's just the product rule.

272
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,260
Now the next
example is this one.

273
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,155
And here we're going to use the
general product rule to get it.

274
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,190


275
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:16,160
The probability of win-lose-win
by the general product rule

276
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,440
is the probability that
you win the first game

277
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,820
times the probability you
lose the second game given

278
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:30,640
the that you win the first
times the probability you

279
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,786
win the third given what?

280
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:38,740
What am I given on
the product rule?

281
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,582
Won the first, lost the second.

282
00:15:43,582 --> 00:15:44,419
All right.

283
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:45,960
Well, now we can
fill in the numbers.

284
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,768
The probability I win
the first is a 1/2.

285
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:52,740
The probability that
I lose the second

286
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:57,720
given that I won the
first, that's 1/3.

287
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,440
And then this one
here, the probability

288
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,680
that I win the third
given that I won the first

289
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,600
and lost the second,
that simplifies

290
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,160
the probability I win the third
given that I lost the second.

291
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,795
Doesn't matter what
happened on the first.

292
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:12,420
And that's 1/3.

293
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,010


294
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:24,650
So this is 1/2 times
1/3 times 1/3 is 118.

295
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,090
And that's 1/18.

296
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,480
And it's just the product
because the product rule

297
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,290
saying product of
the first probability

298
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,910
times this one, which is
the conditional probability

299
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,080
of being here times
this one, which

300
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,600
is a conditional probability if
these events happened before.

301
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,180
Any questions about that?

302
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,240
Very simple to
do, which is good.

303
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:51,740
Yeah.

304
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,590
Is there a question?

305
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,090
OK.

306
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:54,714
All right.

307
00:16:54,714 --> 00:16:56,630
So let's fill in the
other probabilities here.

308
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,500
I got 1/2, 1/3, and 2/3.

309
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,820
That's 1/9.

310
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,650
Same thing here is 1/9.

311
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:08,670
This is 1/18 and 1/3.

312
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,069


313
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,569
OK.

314
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:15,319
So those are the probabilities
in the sample points.

315
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:20,119
Now, to compute the probability
of winning the series given

316
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:23,124
that we won the first game,
let's define the events here.

317
00:17:23,124 --> 00:17:26,890


318
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,355
So A be the event that
we win the series.

319
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:36,220


320
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:42,420
B will be the event that
we win the first game.

321
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,580


322
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,560
And I want to compute the
probability of A given B.

323
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,020
And we use our formula.

324
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,825
Where's the formula for that?

325
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,170
It's way back over there.

326
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,210
The probability of A
given B is the probability

327
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:04,710
of both happening, the
probability of A and B

328
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,450
divided by the probability of B.

329
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,620
So now I just have to
compute these probabilities.

330
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:16,700
So to do that I got to figure
out which sample points are

331
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,820
in A and B here.

332
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,030
So let's write that down.

333
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:27,750
There's A, B, A
and B. All right.

334
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,780
So A is the event that
we win the series.

335
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,670


336
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:42,910
Now this sample point qualifies,
that one does, and this one.

337
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,530
B is the event we
won the first game.

338
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,360
And that's these
three sample points.

339
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:54,521
And then A and B
intersect B is these two.

340
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:55,020
All right.

341
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,560
So for each event
that I care about

342
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,684
I figure out which sample
points are in that event.

343
00:18:58,684 --> 00:19:01,370


344
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,570
And now I just add
the probabilities up.

345
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:08,740
So what's the
probability of A and B?

346
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:17,400


347
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,070
7/18.

348
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:19,750
1/3 plus 1/18.

349
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:24,810


350
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,165
What's the probability of B?

351
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:30,661


352
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:31,160
Yeah.

353
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,330
1/2, 9/18.

354
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:33,430
I got these three points.

355
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:37,070


356
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:43,770
So this'll be 1/3 third plus
1/18 plus the extra one, 1/9.

357
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:49,340
So I've got 7/18 over 9/18.

358
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,640
7/9 is the answer.

359
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,470
So the probability
we win the Series

360
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,370
given we won the
first game is 7/9.

361
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:59,032


362
00:19:59,032 --> 00:19:59,615
Any questions?

363
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:03,050


364
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,090
We're going to do this same
thing about 10 different times.

365
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:06,850
OK?

366
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,170
And it will look a little
different each time maybe.

367
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,250
But it's the same idea.

368
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,780
And the beauty here is
it's really easy to do.

369
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,400
I'm going to give you a
lot of confusing examples.

370
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,696
But really, if you just do this
is it's going to be very easy.

371
00:20:20,696 --> 00:20:21,220
All right.

372
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,670
Somebody talked about the
series lasting three games.

373
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,722
What's the probability the
series lasts three games?

374
00:20:27,722 --> 00:20:29,712
Can anybody look at
that and tell me?

375
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:33,410


376
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:37,310
1/3 because what you would do
is add up these three sample

377
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,100
points.

378
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,910
And it's the opposite
of these two.

379
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,690
So it's 2/3 chance of two games,
a 1/3 chance of three games.

380
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,910
So it's not likely
to go three games.

381
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,640
All right.

382
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,860
So to this point,
we've seen examples

383
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,830
of a conditional
probability where

384
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:03,570
it's A given B where A follows
B, like, we're told B happened.

385
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,370
Now what's the chance of
A. And A is coming later.

386
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,990
The probability of
winning today's game

387
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:12,950
given that you won yesterday's
game, the probability

388
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:17,770
of winning the series given
you already won the first game.

389
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:21,140
Next, we're going to look
at the opposite scenario

390
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,320
where the events are
reversed in order.

391
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,240
The probability that
you won the first game

392
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,294
given that you won the series.

393
00:21:32,294 --> 00:21:33,120
All right.

394
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,140
Now, this is
inherently confusing

395
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,170
because if you're
trying to figure--

396
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:43,360
if you know you
the series, well,

397
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,370
you already know what
happened in the first game

398
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:47,270
because it's been played.

399
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,270
So how could there be
any probability there?

400
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,240
It happened.

401
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,460
Well, so what the meaning
is is over all the times

402
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,862
where the series
was played, sort

403
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:58,570
of what fraction of
the time did the team

404
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,760
that won the series win
the first game is one

405
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,330
way you could think about it.

406
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,120
Or, maybe you just don't know.

407
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,024
The game was played.

408
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,190
You know you won the series.

409
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,300
But you don't know who
won the first game.

410
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,540
And so you could think of a
probability still being there.

411
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,220
Now when you think about it,
it gets me confused still.

412
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,840
But just think about
it like the math.

413
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,981
It's the same formula.

414
00:22:21,981 --> 00:22:22,480
OK.

415
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,800
It doesn't matter which
happened first in time.

416
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,750
You use the same mathematics.

417
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,310
In fact, they give a special
name these kinds of things.

418
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:34,480
They're called a postieri
conditional probabilities.

419
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:50,410


420
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:55,060
It's a fancy name for just
saying that things are out

421
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,711
of order in time.

422
00:22:57,711 --> 00:22:58,210
All right?

423
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:07,920
So it's a probability of B given
A where B precedes A in time.

424
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,100


425
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,150
All right?

426
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:17,760
So it's the same math.

427
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,500
It's just they're out of order.

428
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,910
So let's figure
out the probability

429
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:30,090
that you won the first game
given that you want the series.

430
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,570
Let's figure it out.

431
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:38,330
So I want probability of B
given A now for this example.

432
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:42,620
Well, it's just the
probability of B and A

433
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:47,590
over the probability of A.

434
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,930
We already computed the
probability of A and B.

435
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,950
That's 1/3 plus 1/18.

436
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:56,380


437
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,760
what's the probability
of A, the probability

438
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,290
of winning the first game?

439
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,705


440
00:24:04,705 --> 00:24:05,205
1/2.

441
00:24:05,205 --> 00:24:08,090
It's those three sample points
and they better add up to 1/2

442
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,590
because we sort of said, the
probability of the first game's

443
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,350
1/2.

444
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,900
So that's over
1/2, which is 9/18.

445
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,780


446
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,200
Well this was 7/18 over 9/18.

447
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,980
It's 7/9.

448
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,560
So the probability of
winning the first game given

449
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,076
that you won series is 7/9.

450
00:24:27,076 --> 00:24:29,950


451
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,218
Anybody notice anything
unusual about that answer here?

452
00:24:34,218 --> 00:24:37,630
It's the same as the
answer over there.

453
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:38,380
Is that a theorem?

454
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,970


455
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,470
No.

456
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,920
The probability of A
given B is not always

457
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,230
the probability of B given
A. It was in this case.

458
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,070
It is not always true.

459
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,310
In fact, we could
make a simple example

460
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:53,935
to see why that's
not always the case.

461
00:24:53,935 --> 00:25:07,191


462
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:07,690
All right.

463
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,150
So say here's your sample space.

464
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,850
And say that this
is B and this is

465
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:20,990
A. What's the probability
of A given B in this case?

466
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,670


467
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,330
1.

468
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,980
If you're in B-- wait.

469
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,480
No.

470
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,850
It's not 1.

471
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:32,820
What's the probability of
A given B If I got some--

472
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,970
probably less than 1.

473
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,210
Might be I've drawn it as
1/3 third if it was uniform.

474
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,730
But in this case, the
probability of A given B

475
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,580
is less than 1.

476
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,450
What's the probability
of B given A?

477
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:47,240


478
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,815
1, because if I'm in A I'm
definitely in B. All right.

479
00:25:53,815 --> 00:25:55,940
So that's an example where
they would be different.

480
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:59,450
And that's the generic
case is they're different.

481
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,840
All right?

482
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,360
When are they equal because
they were equal in this case?

483
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,640
What makes them equal?

484
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,330
Let's see.

485
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,900
When does the
probability of A given B

486
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,170
equal a probability
of B given A?

487
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:16,135
Let's see.

488
00:26:16,135 --> 00:26:19,150
Well, If I plug-in
the formula, this

489
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:26,410
equals the probability of A and
B over the probability of B.

490
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:35,000
That equals the probability of
B and A over a probability of A.

491
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,030
So when are those equal?

492
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:39,430


493
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:39,930
Yeah.

494
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:43,380
When probability A equals
probability B. All right.

495
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,070
So that's one case.

496
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:48,152


497
00:26:48,152 --> 00:26:49,310
What's the other case?

498
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:54,230


499
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,520
Yeah-- when it's 0.

500
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,460
Probability-- there's
no intersection.

501
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,724
Probability of A
intersect B is 0.

502
00:26:59,724 --> 00:27:00,640
That's the other case.

503
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:07,071


504
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:07,570
All right.

505
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:10,030
But usually these
conditions won't

506
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,690
apply-- just happened to in
this example by coincidence.

507
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:16,320


508
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,750
Any questions about that?

509
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,650
All right.

510
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,150
Yeah.

511
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,399
So the math is the same with
a postieri probabilities.

512
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,210
It's really, really easy.

513
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:29,830
All right.

514
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,515
So let's do another simple
example that'll start to maybe

515
00:27:33,515 --> 00:27:34,640
be a little more confusing.

516
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,470


517
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,590
Say we've got two coins.

518
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:53,510


519
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,080
One of them is a fair coin.

520
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,200


521
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,530
And by that, I mean the
probability comes up

522
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,560
heads is the same as
the probability comes up

523
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,980
tails is 1/2.

524
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,770
The other one is an unfair coin.

525
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:12,440


526
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,056
And in this case, that
means it's always heads.

527
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:17,930
The probability of heads is 1.

528
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:21,392
The probability of tails is 0.

529
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:22,540
All right?

530
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,370
I've got two such coins here.

531
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:26,330
All right.

532
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:30,870
Here is the unfair
coin-- heads and heads.

533
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:33,480
Actually, they make these things
look like quarters sometimes.

534
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,200
Here's the fair coin--
heads and tails.

535
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:38,900
All right.

536
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:45,410
Now suppose I pick one of
these at random, 50-50,

537
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:50,590
I pick one of
these things, and I

538
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:57,459
flip it, which I'm doing behind
my back, and lo and behold,

539
00:28:57,459 --> 00:28:58,875
it comes out and,
you see a heads.

540
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:02,240


541
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,790
What's the probability
I'm holding the fair coin?

542
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:11,010


543
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:15,700
I picked the coin,
50-50, behind my back.

544
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:21,420
So one answer is, I picked the
fair coin with 50% probability.

545
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:24,210
But then I flipped
it behind my back

546
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,120
and I showed you the
result. And you see heads.

547
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,250
Of course, if I'd
have shown you tails,

548
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,850
You would have known for
sure it was the fair coin

549
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:34,960
because that's the only
one with the tails.

550
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,400
But you don't know for sure now.

551
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,400
You see a heads.

552
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,280
What's the probability this is
the fair coin given that you

553
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,470
saw a heads after the flip?

554
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,370
How many people think 1/2?

555
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,940
After all, I picked it
with probability 1/2.

556
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,890
How many people think
it's less than 1/2?

557
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:55,680
Good.

558
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,530
OK.

559
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,110
Somebody even said 1/3.

560
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,530
Does that sound right?

561
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,870
A couple people like 1/3.

562
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,160
OK.

563
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,660
All right.

564
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,990
Now, part of what
makes this tricky

565
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:13,950
is I told you I picked the
coin with 50% probability.

566
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,730
But then I gave you information.

567
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:19,594
So I've conditioned the problem.

568
00:30:19,594 --> 00:30:21,010
And so this is one
of those things

569
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,130
you could have an
ask Marilyn about.

570
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,350
Is it 1/2 or is it 1/3?

571
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,530
Because I picked
it with 50% chance,

572
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:30,900
what does the
information do for you?

573
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:34,190
Now, I'll give you a clue.

574
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:37,660
Bobo might have written
in and said it's 1/2.

575
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,784
And his proof is that
three other mathematicians

576
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:40,450
agreed with him.

577
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,640
[LAUGHTER]

578
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,690
All right?

579
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,550
OK.

580
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:48,030
So let's figure it out.

581
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:50,320
And really it's very simple.

582
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,550
It's just drawing out
the tree and computing

583
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,480
the conditional probability.

584
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,070
So we're going to do the same
thing over and over again

585
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:03,464
because it just works
for every problem.

586
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:07,950
Of course, you could imagine
debating this for awhile,

587
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,890
arguing with somebody.

588
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,200
Is it 1/2 or 1/3?

589
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:14,439
Much simpler just to do it.

590
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,605
So the first thing is we
have, which coin is picked?

591
00:31:16,605 --> 00:31:19,300


592
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,040
So it could be
fair-- and I told you

593
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:26,650
that happens with
probability 1/2-- or unfair,

594
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:29,300
which is also 1/2.

595
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,290
Then we have the flip.

596
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,570
The fair coin is
equally likely to be

597
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,170
heads or tails, each with 1/2.

598
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:46,190
The unfair coin, guaranteed
to be heads, probability 1.

599
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:46,730
All right.

600
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,510
Now we get the sample
point outcomes.

601
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,310
It's fair in heads with
the probability 1/4,

602
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:57,990
fair in tails,
probability 1/4, unfair

603
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:01,580
in heads, probability 1/2.

604
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:05,070
Now we define the
events of interest.

605
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,510
A is going to be that
we chose the fair coin.

606
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:13,670


607
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:16,450
And B is at the
result, is heads.

608
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,980


609
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,150
And of course what
I want to know

610
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:25,640
is the probability that I
chose the fair coin given

611
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,660
that I saw a heads.

612
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:29,610


613
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:32,020
So to do that we
plug in our formula.

614
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:37,750
That's just the
probability of A and B

615
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:42,190
over the probability
of B. And to compute

616
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,890
that I got to figure out
the probability of A and B

617
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,240
and the probability of B.

618
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,110
So I'll make my diagram.

619
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:54,970
A here, B here, A
and B. A is the event

620
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,570
I chose the fair coin.

621
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:00,050
That's these guys.

622
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,850
B is the event the
result is heads.

623
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,490
That's this one and this one.

624
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,070


625
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:12,730
And A intersect B,
That's the only point.

626
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:16,450
So this is really
easy to compute now.

627
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,050
What's the probability
of A and B?

628
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,770


629
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:21,490
1/4.

630
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:24,270
It's just that sample point.

631
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,865
What's the probability of B?

632
00:33:25,865 --> 00:33:28,400


633
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,480
3/4, 1/4 plus 1/2.

634
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,100


635
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,630
So the probability
of A given B is 1/3.

636
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,650


637
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,400
Really simple to
answer this question.

638
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,300
Just don't even think about it.

639
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,460
Just write down the tree
when you get these things.

640
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:50,752
So much easier just to
write the tree down.

641
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:51,720
All right.

642
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,690
Now the key here is we
knew the probability

643
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,445
of picking the fair
coin in the first place.

644
00:34:01,445 --> 00:34:03,090
Maybe it's worth
writing down what

645
00:34:03,090 --> 00:34:07,268
happens if that's a variable--
sum variable P. Let's do that.

646
00:34:07,268 --> 00:34:15,239


647
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:20,130
For example, what if I hadn't
told you the probability

648
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:22,690
that I picked the fair coin?

649
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:26,420
I just picked one
and flipped it.

650
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:30,130
Think that'll change the answer?

651
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,940
It should because you got
to plug something in there

652
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,927
for the 1/2 for this to work.

653
00:34:34,927 --> 00:34:36,010
So let's see what happens.

654
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:40,889
Say I picked the fair
coin with probability

655
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:46,880
P and the unfair
coin with 1 minus P.

656
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:52,429
And this is the same
heads and tails, 1/2, 1/2.

657
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:56,239
Heads, the probability 1.

658
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:01,520
Well now, instead of 1/4
I get P over 2 up here.

659
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,960
And this is now 1
minus P instead of 1/2.

660
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,580


661
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:12,736
So the probability of A given
B is the probability of A and B

662
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:16,220
is p over 2.

663
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:19,890
And the probability
of B is P over 2

664
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:31,100
plus 1 minus P. That's P over
2 up top, one minus P over 2,

665
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,950
and that is all
multiplied by-- what am I

666
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,720
going to multiply-- 2 here.

667
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:41,210
I'll get P over 2 minus P.

668
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,810
So the probability with which
I picked the coin to start with

669
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,060
impacts the answer here.

670
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:55,680
For example, what if I picked
the unfair coin for sure?

671
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,330
That would be P being 0.

672
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,820


673
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,130
Well, the probability that
I picked the fair coin

674
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,704
is 0 over 2, which is 0.

675
00:36:06,704 --> 00:36:08,870
All right though-- even
know I showed you the heads,

676
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,260
there's no chance it was the
fair coin because I picked

677
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,610
the unfair coin for sure.

678
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:19,840


679
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,020
Same thing if I picked
the fair coin for sure,

680
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,110
better be the case this is 1.

681
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,720
So I get 1 over 2 minus 1.

682
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,400
It's 1.

683
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,380


684
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,610
Any questions?

685
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:36,044
So it's important you know
the probability I picked

686
00:36:36,044 --> 00:36:37,210
the fair coin to start with.

687
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,630
Otherwise, you
can't go anywhere.

688
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,700


689
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,930
All right.

690
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:46,640
What if I do the same game?

691
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,910
Pick a coin with probability p.

692
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:54,291
But now I flip it K times.

693
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:56,400
Say I flip it 100 times.

694
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,340
And every time it
comes up heads.

695
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,420


696
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:04,720
I mean you're pretty sure you
got the unfair coin because you

697
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,850
never saw a tails.

698
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,480
Right?

699
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,220
So let's do that.

700
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,060
Let's compute that scenario.

701
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:16,430
So instead of a single
heads I get K straight heads

702
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,310
and no tails.

703
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:22,290
This would happen with
1 over 2 to the K.

704
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:27,270
This would happen with 1
minus 1 over 2 to the K.

705
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:31,980
So this is now p over 2 to
the K. This is now P1 minus 2

706
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,870
to the minus K.

707
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:36,380
Let's recompute
the probabilities.

708
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:38,657
I'm going somewhere where this.

709
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:39,240
Wait a minute.

710
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:50,340


711
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,800
So now we're
looking at the event

712
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,255
that B is K straight heads.

713
00:37:56,255 --> 00:37:59,080


714
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,150
Come up.

715
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,240
And I want to know
the probability

716
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,420
that I picked the fair coin
given that it just never comes

717
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,700
up tails.

718
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,575
The math is the same.

719
00:38:10,575 --> 00:38:17,390


720
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,895
The probability now that
I picked the fair coin

721
00:38:19,895 --> 00:38:23,310
and got k straight
heads is just p times 2

722
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:31,490
to the minus K. The probability
that I got K straight heads is

723
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:34,210
P times 2 to the minus
K plus the chance

724
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:38,230
I picked the unfair
coin, which is 1 minus P.

725
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:40,340
And if I multiply top
and bottom by 2 to the K,

726
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:47,571
I get P over P plus
to the K 1 minus B.

727
00:38:47,571 --> 00:38:48,070
All right.

728
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:53,290
So it gets very unlikely that
I've got the fair coin here

729
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,280
as K gets big.

730
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,660
Like if K is 100 I got
a big number down here.

731
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,680
And basically it's
0 chance-- close

732
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,900
to 0 chance of the fair coin.

733
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,910


734
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,760
But now say I do the
following experiment.

735
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,820
I don't tell you P.
But I pull a coin out

736
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,380
and 100 flips in
a row it's heads.

737
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,710
Which coin do you think I have?

738
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,340


739
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:29,300
I flipped it 100 straight times
and it's heads every time.

740
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,550


741
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,050
Yeah.

742
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,341
There's not enough information.

743
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:34,990
You don't know.

744
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,840
What do you want to say?

745
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,890
You want to say
it's the unfair coin

746
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:46,250
but you have no idea because I
might have picked the fair coin

747
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:48,790
with probability 1, in which
case it is the fair coin

748
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,000
and it just was unlucky
that it came up heads

749
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,270
100 times in a row.

750
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,530
But it could be.

751
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,730
So you could say nothing if you
don't know the probability P.

752
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:05,370
Because sure enough, if
I plug in P being 1 here,

753
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,850
that wipes out the 2 to the K
and I just get probability 1.

754
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:10,600


755
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,940
OK?

756
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:13,440
All right.

757
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,510
Now when this comes
up in practice

758
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,560
is with things like polling.

759
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,680
Like, we just had an election.

760
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,430
And people do poles
ahead of time.

761
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:28,850
And they sample
thousands of voters

762
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:31,160
from 1% of the population.

763
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,590
And they say, OK,
that 60% of the people

764
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:37,240
are going to vote Republican.

765
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,880
And they might have a margin of
error, three points, whatever

766
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,380
that means.

767
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,580
And we'll figure
that out next week.

768
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,920
What does that tell you about
the electorate as a whole--

769
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,180
the population if they sample 1%
at random, 60% are Republican.

770
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,572
Yeah?

771
00:40:54,572 --> 00:40:58,476
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
The options you have,

772
00:40:58,476 --> 00:41:00,428
is it all heads or
is it all tails?

773
00:41:00,428 --> 00:41:01,892
It should be one
option all heads

774
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:03,860
and another option
at least one tails.

775
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,910
PROFESSOR: You're right.

776
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,320
Oops.

777
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:06,940
All right.

778
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:07,903
At least one tail for this one.

779
00:41:07,903 --> 00:41:08,402
Yeah.

780
00:41:08,402 --> 00:41:10,168
Good.

781
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:11,530
That is true.

782
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,870
OK.

783
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:18,550
Any questions
about that example?

784
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,550
OK.

785
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,300
Now we're back to the
election and there's

786
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:26,520
a pole that says they sampled
1% of the population at random

787
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,540
and 60% said they're
going to vote Republican.

788
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:32,570
And the margin of error
is 3% or something.

789
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:36,510
What does that tell you about
the population of the country?

790
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,900
Nothing.

791
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,560
That's right.

792
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,490
It is what it is.

793
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:47,200
All you can conclude is
that either the population

794
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,920
is close to 60% Republican
or you were unlucky

795
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,740
in the 1% you sample.

796
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:59,120
That's what you can conclude
because the population really

797
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,110
is fixed in this case.

798
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:01,060
It is what it is.

799
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,090
There's no randomness
in the population.

800
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:04,590
All right?

801
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:07,630
So you have next
week for recitation.

802
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,890
You're going to design a
pole and work through how

803
00:42:09,890 --> 00:42:11,640
to calculate the margin
of error and work

804
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,640
through what that
really means in terms

805
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,410
of what the population is like.

806
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,530
Now of course, if it comes
out 100 straight times heads,

807
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,590
you've got to be really
unlucky to have the fair coin.

808
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,460
And the same thing
with designing the poll

809
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,270
if you're way off.

810
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:32,761
Any questions about that?

811
00:42:32,761 --> 00:42:33,260
OK.

812
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,970
The next example comes up
all the time in practice.

813
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,946
And that's with medical testing.

814
00:42:40,946 --> 00:42:43,547
Maybe I'll leave-- no.

815
00:42:43,547 --> 00:42:44,380
I'll take that down.

816
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,634
We know that now.

817
00:42:45,634 --> 00:43:05,030


818
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,520
Now in this case--
in fact, this is

819
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,530
a question we had on the
final exam a few years ago.

820
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:14,230
And there's a good chance
this kind of question's

821
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,340
going to be on the
final this year.

822
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,760
There's a disease out there.

823
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,390
And you can have a test for it.

824
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,507
But like most medical
tests, they're not perfect.

825
00:43:24,507 --> 00:43:26,840
Sometimes when it says you've
got the disease you really

826
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:27,900
don't.

827
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,657
And if it ways you don't
have it, you really do.

828
00:43:31,657 --> 00:43:33,240
So in this case,
we're going to assume

829
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:45,914
that 10% of the population has
the disease, whatever it is.

830
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,330
You don't get
symptoms right away.

831
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:49,190
So you have this test.

832
00:43:49,190 --> 00:44:04,142
But if you have the disease
there is a 10% chance

833
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:05,225
that the test is negative.

834
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:08,940


835
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:15,040
And this is called
a false negative,

836
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,410
because the test comes back
negative but it's wrong,

837
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:19,750
because you have the disease.

838
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,620
And similarly, if you
have the disease--

839
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:29,240
or sorry-- if you
don't have the disease,

840
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:35,170
there's a 30% chance that
the test comes back positive.

841
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:41,560
And it's called a false positive
because it came back positive,

842
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,870
but you don't have it.

843
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:45,800
So the test is pretty good.

844
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:46,500
Right?

845
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:52,390
It's 10% false negative right,
30% false positive right.

846
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:59,210
Now say you select a random
person and they test positive.

847
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:01,120
What you want to know
is the probability

848
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,014
they have the disease given
that it's a random person.

849
00:45:04,014 --> 00:45:07,730


850
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:12,630
So actually, this came
up in my personal life.

851
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:18,080
Many years ago when my wife
was pregnant with Alex,

852
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,840
she was exposed to somebody
with TB here at MIT.

853
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,400
And she took the test.

854
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,040
And it came back positive.

855
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:30,639
Now the bad thing--
TB's a bad thing.

856
00:45:30,639 --> 00:45:31,680
You don't want to get it.

857
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,990
But the medicine for it
you take for six months.

858
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:37,760
And she was worried
about taking medicine

859
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,530
for six months when she's
pregnant because who

860
00:45:40,530 --> 00:45:43,830
knows what the TB medicine
does kind of thing

861
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,940
if you have a baby.

862
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,440
So she asked the doc, what's
the probability I really

863
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,320
have the disease?

864
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,570
The doc doesn't know.

865
00:45:53,570 --> 00:45:55,620
The doc maybe could give
you some of these steps,

866
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:58,350
10% false negative,
30% false positive.

867
00:45:58,350 --> 00:45:59,760
But it tested positive.

868
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,530
So they just normally
give you the medicine.

869
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,140
So say this was the story.

870
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,490
What would you say?

871
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:07,670
What do you think?

872
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:10,090
How many people think that
it's a least a 70% chance

873
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,900
you got the disease?

874
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,930
She tested positive
and it's only

875
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:16,820
got a 30% false positive rate.

876
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,701
Anybody?

877
00:46:18,701 --> 00:46:21,260
So you don't think
she's likely to have it.

878
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,720
How many people think
it's better than 50-50

879
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,820
you have the disease?

880
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:27,870
A few.

881
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:31,420
How many people
think less than 50%.

882
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,290
A bunch.

883
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:33,070
Yeah.

884
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:36,250
You're right, in fact.

885
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:37,440
Let's figure out the answer.

886
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,550
It's easy to do.

887
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:43,935
So A is the event the
person has the disease.

888
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:51,800


889
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:56,835
And B is the event that
the person tests positive.

890
00:46:56,835 --> 00:47:01,120


891
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,400
And of course what
we want to know

892
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,670
is the probability you
have the disease given

893
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:07,550
that you tested positive.

894
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:11,420
And that's just the probability
of both events divided

895
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:16,340
by the probability
of testing positive.

896
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:20,060
So let's figure that
out by drawing the tree.

897
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:38,750


898
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,970
So first, do you
have the disease?

899
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,980


900
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,360
And it's yes or no.

901
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:49,320


902
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:50,380
And let's see.

903
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,250
The probability of
having the disease, what

904
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,010
is that for a random person?

905
00:47:56,010 --> 00:47:56,810
10%.

906
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:58,380
that the stat.

907
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,274
So it's-- actually,
we'll call it 0.1.

908
00:48:01,274 --> 00:48:03,997
And 9.9 you don't have it.

909
00:48:03,997 --> 00:48:05,080
And then there's the test.

910
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,940


911
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,995
Well, you can be
positive or negative.

912
00:48:09,995 --> 00:48:14,360


913
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:19,520
Now if you have
the disease, there

914
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:26,880
is a-- the chance you
test negative is 10%, 0.1.

915
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,352
Therefore there's a 90%
chance you test positive.

916
00:48:31,352 --> 00:48:32,810
Now if, you don't
have the disease,

917
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:33,893
you could test either way.

918
00:48:33,893 --> 00:48:36,740


919
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:40,390
If you don't have the
disease there's a 30% chance

920
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,590
you test positive.

921
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:47,760
30 here and 70% percent
chance you're negative.

922
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:51,620
Now we can compute each
sample point probability.

923
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:56,560
This one is 0.1
times 0.9 is 0.09.

924
00:48:56,560 --> 00:49:00,050
0.1 times 1 is 0.01.

925
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:03,720
0.9 and 0.3 is 0.27.

926
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:09,580
0.9 and 0.7 is 0.63.

927
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,350
So all sample points
are figured out.

928
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:16,240
Now we figure out which sample
points are in which sets.

929
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,650
So we have event A, event B,
and A intersect B. Let's see.

930
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:25,300
A is the event you
have the disease.

931
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,590
That's these guys.

932
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,790
B is the event
you test positive.

933
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:36,840
That's this one and this one.

934
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:40,521
A intersect B is just this one.

935
00:49:40,521 --> 00:49:41,020
All right.

936
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,149
We're almost done.

937
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:44,690
Let's just figure
out the probability

938
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,190
you have the disease.

939
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:49,000
What's the probability
of A intersect B?

940
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,340


941
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:53,120
0.09.

942
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,740
It's just that one sample point.

943
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,645
What's the probability
that you tested positive?

944
00:49:59,645 --> 00:50:02,170


945
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:03,230
0.36.

946
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:03,730
Yeah.

947
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:13,610
0.09 plus 0.27, which is 0.36.

948
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:21,430
So I got 0.09 over 0.36 is 1/4.

949
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:22,790
Wow.

950
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,071
That seems bizarre.

951
00:50:24,071 --> 00:50:24,570
Right?

952
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:28,740
You've got a test, 10%
percent false negative,

953
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:30,250
30% false positive.

954
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:34,060
Yet, when you test positive
there's only a 25% chance

955
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:36,490
you have the disease.

956
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:38,610
So maybe you don't
take the medicine.

957
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,830
So if there's risk
both ways, probably

958
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:42,930
don't have the disease.

959
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:44,970
Yeah?

960
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:46,470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
disease change

961
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:47,970
because you've
already been exposed

962
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:48,970
to somebody that has it?

963
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:52,530
PROFESSOR: That's a
great point, great point,

964
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,440
because there's
additional information

965
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,190
conditioning this in the
personal example I cited.

966
00:50:57,190 --> 00:50:59,250
You were exposed to somebody.

967
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,030
So we need to condition
on that as well, which

968
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:04,250
raises the chance
you have the disease.

969
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,040
That's a great point.

970
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,950
Yeah.

971
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:10,420
Just like in the-- well, we
haven't got to that example.

972
00:51:10,420 --> 00:51:12,420
Do another example with
that exact kind of thing

973
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:14,431
is very important.

974
00:51:14,431 --> 00:51:14,930
All right.

975
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:17,920
So this is sort of
paradoxical that it

976
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,120
looks like a pretty good
test-- low false positive,

977
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,460
full false negatives, but
likely be wrong, at least if it

978
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,637
tells you have the disease.

979
00:51:28,637 --> 00:51:29,720
In fact, let's figure out.

980
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,720
What's the probability
that the test is correct?

981
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,620


982
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:39,130
What's the probability the
test is right in general?

983
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:43,030


984
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,350
72%.

985
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:45,570
Let's see.

986
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:48,731
So it would be 0.09 plus 0.63.

987
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:49,231
72%.

988
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:56,780


989
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,704
So it's likely to be right.

990
00:51:59,704 --> 00:52:01,370
But if it tells you
you have the disease

991
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:02,460
it's likely to be wrong.

992
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,500


993
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:06,850
It's hard.

994
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,530
Why is this happening?

995
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:09,780
Why does it come out that way?

996
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:10,280
Yeah?

997
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,980


998
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,190
AUDIENCE: Then there is
only a 1 in 64 chance

999
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:18,630
that you have the disease.

1000
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,790
So if it comes back
negative, then it's

1001
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:22,584
a pretty good indication
that you're OK.

1002
00:52:22,584 --> 00:52:23,250
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1003
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,980
If it comes back negative than
it really is doing very well.

1004
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,907
That's right.

1005
00:52:27,907 --> 00:52:29,615
But why is it when it
comes back positive

1006
00:52:29,615 --> 00:52:32,156
that you're unlikely to have
the disease if it's a good test.

1007
00:52:32,156 --> 00:52:32,886
Yeah.

1008
00:52:32,886 --> 00:52:34,260
AUDIENCE: The
disease is so rare.

1009
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,760
PROFESSOR: The
disease is so rare.

1010
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,500
Absolutely.

1011
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,770
This number here is so small.

1012
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:41,960
And that's what's doing it.

1013
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,020
Because if you look at how
many people have the disease

1014
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,120
and test positive, it's 0.09.

1015
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:50,270
So many people don't
have the disease

1016
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:53,120
that even with a small false
positive rate, this number

1017
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:55,380
swamps out that number.

1018
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,930
In fact, imagine
nobody had the disease.

1019
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:00,420
You'd have a 0 here.

1020
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,140
All right?

1021
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:04,750
And then you would always be
wrong if you said you had it.

1022
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,480
OK?

1023
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:08,780
That's good.

1024
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,280
OK.

1025
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:11,980
This comes up in weather
prediction, the same paradox.

1026
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,050
For example, say you're
trying to predict

1027
00:53:14,050 --> 00:53:15,750
the weather for Seattle.

1028
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,160
Sometimes it seems
like this in Boston.

1029
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:22,490
And you just say,
it's going to rain.

1030
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:25,272
Forget all the fancy weather
forecasting stuff, the radar,

1031
00:53:25,272 --> 00:53:25,980
and all the rest.

1032
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,440
Just say it's going
to rain tomorrow.

1033
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,942
You're going to be right
almost all the time.

1034
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:31,620
All right?

1035
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,350
And in fact, if you
try to do fancy stuff,

1036
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,220
you're probably going to
be wrong more of the time.

1037
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:37,800
All right.

1038
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,130
For example, in this
case, if you just

1039
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:44,510
say the person does not have the
disease, forget the lab test.

1040
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:47,551
Just come back with negative.

1041
00:53:47,551 --> 00:53:48,550
How often are you right?

1042
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:51,870


1043
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:54,190
90% of the time you're right.

1044
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,460
Much better than the test
you paid a lot of money for.

1045
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:59,050


1046
00:53:59,050 --> 00:53:59,850
I see.

1047
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:02,630
You've got to be careful
what you're looking for,

1048
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:06,500
how you measure the value
of a test or a prediction.

1049
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:08,140
Because presumably
the one you paid

1050
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:14,240
for is better, even though
accurate less of the time.

1051
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,004
Any questions about that?

1052
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:20,350


1053
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:22,030
OK.

1054
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,530
So For the rest of
today we're going

1055
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:27,160
to do three more paradoxes.

1056
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,990
And in each case
they're going to expose

1057
00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:33,220
a flaw in our intuition
about probability.

1058
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:34,832
But the good news
is in each case it's

1059
00:54:34,832 --> 00:54:36,040
easy to get the right answer.

1060
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:39,640
Just stick with the math and
try not to think about it.

1061
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:44,090
Now the first example
is a game involving

1062
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:48,240
dice that's called carnival dice
that you can find in carnivals

1063
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,175
and you can also
find in casinos.

1064
00:54:50,175 --> 00:54:53,150


1065
00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:57,050
It's a pretty popular
game, actually.

1066
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:59,775
So the way it works
is as follows.

1067
00:54:59,775 --> 00:55:07,310


1068
00:55:07,310 --> 00:55:21,360
The player picks a number from
1 to 6-- we'll call it N--

1069
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,650
and then rolls three dice.

1070
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:26,006
And let's say they're fair
and mutually independent.

1071
00:55:26,006 --> 00:55:34,970


1072
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:36,470
We haven't talked
about independent.

1073
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:38,460
So they're fair dice.

1074
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,250
For now, normal
dice-- nothing fishy.

1075
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:50,780
And the player wins if and
only if the number he picked

1076
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,455
comes up on at least
one of the dice.

1077
00:55:52,455 --> 00:55:58,100


1078
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,830
So you either win
or you lose the game

1079
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:03,375
depending on if your lucky
number came up at least once.

1080
00:56:03,375 --> 00:56:05,960


1081
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,590
Now you've got three dice,
each of which has a 1

1082
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:10,740
in 6 chance of coming
up a winner for you.

1083
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:13,420


1084
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:17,730
So how many people think
this is a fair game-- you

1085
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:22,730
got a 50-50 chance of
winning-- three dice, each 1/6

1086
00:56:22,730 --> 00:56:24,290
chance of winning?

1087
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:27,540
Anybody think it's
not a fair game?

1088
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:28,420
A bunch of you.

1089
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,840
How many people think it
is a fair game-- 50-50?

1090
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:32,601
A few.

1091
00:56:32,601 --> 00:56:33,100
All right.

1092
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,479
Well, let's figure it out.

1093
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:38,270
And instead of doing
the tree method, which

1094
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,728
we know we're
supposed to do, we're

1095
00:56:39,728 --> 00:56:46,284
just going to wing it, which
is always seems easier to do.

1096
00:56:46,284 --> 00:56:51,650


1097
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:54,180
If you're in the Casino
you want to just wing it

1098
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:57,970
instead of taking your napkin
out and drawing a tree.

1099
00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:07,740
So the claim, question mark, is
the probability you win in 1/2.

1100
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:15,250
And the proof, question
mark, is you let Ai

1101
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:25,220
be the event that the i-th die
comes up N. And i is 1 to 3

1102
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:26,867
here.

1103
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:27,700
So then you say, OK.

1104
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:33,300
The probability I win is
the probability of A1--

1105
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:38,010
I could win that
way-- or A2, or A3.

1106
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:41,810
All I need is one of the
die to come up my way.

1107
00:57:41,810 --> 00:57:45,430
And that is the
probability of A1

1108
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:52,210
plus the probability of A2
plus the probability of A3.

1109
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:54,555
And each die wins for
me with probability 1/6.

1110
00:57:54,555 --> 00:57:59,345


1111
00:57:59,345 --> 00:58:00,220
And that is then 1/2.

1112
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:03,460


1113
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:09,706
So that's a proof that we
win with probability of 1/2.

1114
00:58:09,706 --> 00:58:13,160
What do you think?

1115
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,387
Any problems with that proof?

1116
00:58:14,387 --> 00:58:15,262
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1117
00:58:15,262 --> 00:58:20,489


1118
00:58:20,489 --> 00:58:22,030
PROFESSOR: Well
that's a great point.

1119
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:22,850
Yeah.

1120
00:58:22,850 --> 00:58:25,950
So if I extended this
nice proof technique

1121
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:29,110
I couldn't have probability of
7/6 of winning with seven die.

1122
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,250
Yeah?

1123
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:31,125
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1124
00:58:31,125 --> 00:58:34,874


1125
00:58:34,874 --> 00:58:35,540
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1126
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,990
You're very close.

1127
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:41,062
I didn't technically
assume that.

1128
00:58:41,062 --> 00:58:43,970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1129
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:45,450
PROFESSOR: They could double up.

1130
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:46,580
Yeah.

1131
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:50,040
There's no intersection
in the events.

1132
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:53,220
In fact, there is
intersection because there's

1133
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,740
a chance I rolled
all six-- all Ns.

1134
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:57,680
Say N is 6.

1135
00:58:57,680 --> 00:58:59,810
I could roll all sixes
and then each of these

1136
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:00,990
would be a winner.

1137
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:03,604
But I don't get to
count them separately.

1138
00:59:03,604 --> 00:59:05,020
Then I only win
once in that case.

1139
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,290
In other words, all of
these could turned on

1140
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:08,060
at the same time.

1141
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:09,268
There's an intersection here.

1142
00:59:09,268 --> 00:59:13,570
So this rule does not hold.

1143
00:59:13,570 --> 00:59:16,290
I need the Ai to be
disjoined for this

1144
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:20,380
to be true-- the
events to be disjoined.

1145
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,110
And they're not
disjoined because there's

1146
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:25,040
a sample point were
two or more of the die

1147
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,470
could come up the same
being a winner, which

1148
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:33,560
means the same sample
point, namely all die are N,

1149
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,960
comes up in each of these three.

1150
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:36,530
So they're not disjoined.

1151
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:40,690
Now what's the principal
you used two weeks ago when

1152
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:46,560
you did cardinality of a set--
cardinality of a union of sets?

1153
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,480
Inclusion, exclusion.

1154
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,700
And the same thing
needs to be done here.

1155
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:55,870


1156
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:57,364
So let's do that.

1157
00:59:57,364 --> 00:59:59,405
And then we'll figure out
the actual probability.

1158
00:59:59,405 --> 01:00:03,450


1159
01:00:03,450 --> 01:00:08,130
So this is a fact based on the
inclusion, exclusion principle.

1160
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:13,510
The probability of A1,
union A2, union A3,

1161
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:17,680
is just what you think it would
be from inclusion, exclusion.

1162
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,610
It's a probability of
A1 plus a probability

1163
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:26,550
of A2 plus the
probability of A3 minus

1164
01:00:26,550 --> 01:00:27,720
the pairwise intersections.

1165
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:33,700


1166
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:39,770
A1 intersect A3 minus
probability of A2 intersect A3.

1167
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,310


1168
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:45,860
And is there anything else?

1169
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,300
Plus, the probably of
all of them matching.

1170
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:54,860


1171
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:55,360
OK.

1172
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:59,070
So the proof is
really the same proof

1173
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:01,676
you use for inclusion,
exclusion with sets.

1174
01:01:01,676 --> 01:01:03,800
The only difference is that
in a probability space,

1175
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,710
we have weights on the elements.

1176
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:09,190
And the weight corresponds
to the probability.

1177
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:14,510
So in fact, if you were drawing
the sample space, say here's A1

1178
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:19,790
and here's A2, and here's A3.

1179
01:01:19,790 --> 01:01:24,860
Well, you need to add the
probabilities here, here,

1180
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:25,770
and here.

1181
01:01:25,770 --> 01:01:30,180
Then you subtract off the double
counting from here, from here,

1182
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:30,790
and from here.

1183
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:33,560
And then you add back again
what you subtracted off

1184
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:36,460
too much there.

1185
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:39,430
Same proof, it's just your
have weights on the elements

1186
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:41,940
of probabilities.

1187
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:42,440
All right.

1188
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,280
So let's figure out
the right probability.

1189
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,550
That's 1/6, 1/6, 1/6.

1190
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:53,700
What's the probability
of the first two die

1191
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,980
matching-- both of them?

1192
01:01:54,980 --> 01:02:00,360


1193
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:02,640
1/36.

1194
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,110
We'll talk more about
why that is next time.

1195
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:09,600
But there's a 6 for A1 then
given that 1/6 for the second

1196
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,260
die matching.

1197
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:15,800
So it's 1/6 times
1/6 minus the 1/36.

1198
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:22,010
1/36, the chance that all three
match is 1/216 or 6 cubed.

1199
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:29,520
So when you add all that up you
get the 0.421 and some more.

1200
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,060
So the chance of
winning this game

1201
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:36,280
is 41% which makes it a
worst game in the casino.

1202
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,560
It is hard to find a
worse game than this.

1203
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,580
Roulette, much better.

1204
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:42,960
We'll study Roulette in the
last lecture-- much better game.

1205
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,990
And even that's a
terrible game to play.

1206
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:47,700
So it looks like an easy game.

1207
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,600
There's a quick proof
that it's 50-50.

1208
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:54,250
But it's horrible odds
against the house.

1209
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:57,660
Now, this is a nice
example because it

1210
01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:01,490
shows how a rule you had for
computing the cardinality

1211
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:05,100
of a set gives you
the probability.

1212
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:05,620
All right.

1213
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:10,210
In fact, all the set laws you
learned a couple weeks ago

1214
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:12,969
work for probability
spaces the same way.

1215
01:03:12,969 --> 01:03:14,760
And there were several
of those in homework

1216
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,400
that you just had
the last problem set.

1217
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,960
Any questions about that?

1218
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:25,660


1219
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,090
OK.

1220
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:31,800
Now in addition, all those
set laws you did also

1221
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,070
work for conditional
probabilities.

1222
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:38,410
For example, this is true.

1223
01:03:38,410 --> 01:03:44,690
The probability of A union B
given C-- whoops-- given C,

1224
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:50,860
is the probability of A given
C plus the probability of B

1225
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:57,030
given C minus the intersection,
A intersect B given

1226
01:03:57,030 --> 01:04:02,180
C. In other words, take any
probability rule you have

1227
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:06,580
and condition everything on an
event, C, and it still works.

1228
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:09,310


1229
01:04:09,310 --> 01:04:11,340
And the proof is not hard.

1230
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:13,580
You can go through
each individual law

1231
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:17,550
but it all comes out to be fine.

1232
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:19,680
All right.

1233
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,770
You have to be a little
careful though because you

1234
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:25,030
got to remember which
side you're doing,

1235
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:27,580
which what you're putting on
either side of the bar here.

1236
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,830
For example, what
about this one?

1237
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:30,540
Is this true?

1238
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:33,080


1239
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:34,900
Claim.

1240
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:37,400
Let's take-- say C
and D are disjoined.

1241
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:42,900


1242
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,690
Is this true?

1243
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:49,870
Then the probability
of A conditioned

1244
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:56,450
on C union D. So given
that either C or D is true,

1245
01:04:56,450 --> 01:05:00,810
does that equal the
probability of A given C

1246
01:05:00,810 --> 01:05:04,420
plus probability of A given D?

1247
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:07,140


1248
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:11,150
We know that if I swapped
all these, it's true.

1249
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:14,362
The probability of C union
D when C and D are disjoined

1250
01:05:14,362 --> 01:05:16,820
is the probability that C given
A plus the probability of D

1251
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:19,030
given A. That I just claimed.

1252
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:20,070
And what about this way?

1253
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:21,685
Can I swap things around?

1254
01:05:21,685 --> 01:05:24,580


1255
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:26,306
Yeah?

1256
01:05:26,306 --> 01:05:32,710
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
would C union D be 0?

1257
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:36,350
PROFESSOR: If C and
D are disjoined,

1258
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:43,050
C union D would just be C union
D. But you're not a good point.

1259
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:44,540
What if C and D are disjoined?

1260
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:45,740
That's a good example.

1261
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:46,406
Let's draw that.

1262
01:05:46,406 --> 01:05:52,726


1263
01:05:52,726 --> 01:05:53,726
Let's look at that case.

1264
01:05:53,726 --> 01:05:57,640


1265
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:00,540
So we've got a
sample space here.

1266
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:05,560
And you've got C
here and D here.

1267
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:09,745
And just for fun, let's make A
be here-- include all of them.

1268
01:06:09,745 --> 01:06:13,140


1269
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:18,680
What's the probability-- is
this going to do what I want?

1270
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:19,230
Yeah.

1271
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:21,504
What's the probability
of A given C?

1272
01:06:21,504 --> 01:06:25,440


1273
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:26,330
1.

1274
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:30,300
If I'm in C I'm in A.
A is everything here.

1275
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:32,970
So the probability
of A given C is one.

1276
01:06:32,970 --> 01:06:36,255
What's the probability
of A given D?

1277
01:06:36,255 --> 01:06:39,220
1.

1278
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:39,720
All right.

1279
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,277
Well, this is a
problem because I

1280
01:06:41,277 --> 01:06:43,860
can't have the probability ot--
what's the probably of A given

1281
01:06:43,860 --> 01:06:46,890
C union D?

1282
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:47,790
Well, it can't be 2.

1283
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:48,950
Right?

1284
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:50,550
It's 1.

1285
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:51,550
They are not equal.

1286
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:54,120


1287
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:58,660
So you cannot do those set
rules on the right side

1288
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:01,020
of the conditioning bar.

1289
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:04,080
You can do them on the
left, not on the right.

1290
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:04,580
All right.

1291
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:05,413
So this is not true.

1292
01:07:05,413 --> 01:07:13,320


1293
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:14,391
Now nobody would do this.

1294
01:07:14,391 --> 01:07:14,890
Right?

1295
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:18,140
I mean, the probability of-- not
that it's-- see this example?

1296
01:07:18,140 --> 01:07:21,520
This you just would never
make this mistake again seeing

1297
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,450
that example.

1298
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:25,420
Everybody understand
the example,

1299
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:27,170
how it's clearly
not always the case

1300
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:28,770
that probability
of A given C union

1301
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:33,015
D is a probability of A given C
plus probability of A given D?

1302
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,390
Because now I'm going to show
you an example where you're

1303
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:38,250
going to swear it's true.

1304
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,372
All right?

1305
01:07:39,372 --> 01:07:40,705
And this is a real life example.

1306
01:07:40,705 --> 01:07:43,660


1307
01:07:43,660 --> 01:07:47,270
Many years ago now there was
a sex discrimination suit

1308
01:07:47,270 --> 01:07:49,320
at Berkeley.

1309
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,170
There was a female professor
in the math department.

1310
01:07:52,170 --> 01:07:54,500
And she was denied tenure.

1311
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,180
And she filed a lawsuit
against Berkeley

1312
01:07:57,180 --> 01:07:59,680
alleging sex discrimination.

1313
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,390
Said she wasn't tenured
because she's a woman.

1314
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:04,661
Now, unfortunately
sex discrimination

1315
01:08:04,661 --> 01:08:06,035
is a problem in
math departments.

1316
01:08:06,035 --> 01:08:09,900
It's historically
been a difficult area.

1317
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,340
But it's always hard to prove.

1318
01:08:11,340 --> 01:08:12,840
It's a nebulous kind of thing.

1319
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,590
They don't say, hey,
you can't have tenure

1320
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,810
because you're a woman.

1321
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:19,550
They'd get sued and
get killed for that.

1322
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:24,020
So she had to get some
mat to back her up.

1323
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:27,569
So what she did is she looked
into Berkeley's practices

1324
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:31,000
and she found that in
all 22 departments,

1325
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,040
every single department,
the percentage

1326
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:38,430
of male PhD applicants
that were accepted

1327
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:43,950
was higher than the percentage
of female PhD applicants

1328
01:08:43,950 --> 01:08:46,069
that were accepted.

1329
01:08:46,069 --> 01:08:49,069
Now you could understand some of
the departments accepting more

1330
01:08:49,069 --> 01:08:50,809
male PhDs than female PhDs.

1331
01:08:50,809 --> 01:08:53,430
But all 22?

1332
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:54,740
What are the odds of that?

1333
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:56,450
I mean, so the
immediate conclusion

1334
01:08:56,450 --> 01:09:00,220
is, well, that's clearly there's
sex discrimination going on

1335
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:01,500
at Berkeley.

1336
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,399
OK?

1337
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:06,260
Well Berkeley took a look at
that and said, nothing good.

1338
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:08,130
That doesn't look good for them.

1339
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:13,140
But they did their own
study of PhD applicants.

1340
01:09:13,140 --> 01:09:16,930
And they said that if the
university as a whole--

1341
01:09:16,930 --> 01:09:21,040
look at the University as a
whole, actually, the women,

1342
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:25,029
the females have a higher
acceptance rate for the PhD

1343
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:27,609
Program than the men.

1344
01:09:27,609 --> 01:09:28,109
So look.

1345
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:29,840
Berkeley said, we're
accepting more women

1346
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,540
than men percentage-wise.

1347
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,620
So how could we be
discriminating against women?

1348
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:38,670
And this is where the same
argument the female faculty

1349
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:41,010
member's making, But they're
saying as a university

1350
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:44,160
as a whole, when you add
up all 22 departments.

1351
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,410
Well, that sounds pretty good.

1352
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:47,790
How could they be
discriminating?

1353
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:48,290
OK.

1354
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:51,790
So the question for you
guys, is it possible that

1355
01:09:51,790 --> 01:09:54,790
both sides we're
telling the truth,

1356
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:57,580
that in every single department
the women have a lower

1357
01:09:57,580 --> 01:10:02,010
acceptance rate than men, but
on the university as a whole

1358
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:04,850
the women are higher percentage?

1359
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:12,450
It sounds like it's-- and just
to avoid any confusion here,

1360
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:17,330
people only apply to one
department and they're only one

1361
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:18,490
sex.

1362
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:21,916
So you can't--
Carroll didn't apply.

1363
01:10:21,916 --> 01:10:25,620
[LAUGHTER]

1364
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:28,210
How many people think that one
of the sides, actually, when

1365
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:30,040
they look at the
studies was wrong,

1366
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:33,070
that they're contradictory?

1367
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:34,270
Nobody?

1368
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:35,852
You've been in 6
over 2 too long.

1369
01:10:35,852 --> 01:10:37,310
How many people
think it's possible

1370
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:40,310
that both sides were right?

1371
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:40,941
Yeah.

1372
01:10:40,941 --> 01:10:41,440
All right.

1373
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,410
So let's see how this works.

1374
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:50,709


1375
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:52,500
And to make it simple
I'm going to get down

1376
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:56,500
to just two departments rather
than try to do data for all 22.

1377
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:59,706
And I'm going to do not the
actual data but something

1378
01:10:59,706 --> 01:11:01,122
that's represents
what's going on.

1379
01:11:01,122 --> 01:11:05,931


1380
01:11:05,931 --> 01:11:06,430
OK.

1381
01:11:06,430 --> 01:11:08,388
So we're going to look
at the following events.

1382
01:11:08,388 --> 01:11:12,210


1383
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:19,340
A is the event that the
applicant is admitted.

1384
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:25,930


1385
01:11:25,930 --> 01:11:30,960
FCS is the event
that the applicant

1386
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:37,645
is female and applying to CS.

1387
01:11:37,645 --> 01:11:40,420


1388
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:43,770
FEE is the event
that the applicant

1389
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:46,815
is female and applying to EE.

1390
01:11:46,815 --> 01:11:49,540


1391
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:59,140
MCS is the event the
applicant is a male and CS.

1392
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:06,150
And then finally we have MEE
is the event the applicant is

1393
01:12:06,150 --> 01:12:08,194
male and in EE.

1394
01:12:08,194 --> 01:12:10,110
So we're just going to
look at two departments

1395
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:13,950
here and try to figure
out if it can happen

1396
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:16,760
that in both departments
the women are worse off

1397
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,148
but if you take the
union they're better off.

1398
01:12:19,148 --> 01:12:25,840


1399
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:30,070
So the female professor's
argument effectively

1400
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:34,030
is, the probability of being
admitted given that you're

1401
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:39,730
a female in CS is less than the
probability of being admitted

1402
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:43,080
given that you're a male at CS.

1403
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,820
And same thing in EE.

1404
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:50,210
Probability of being admitted
in EE if you're a female

1405
01:12:50,210 --> 01:12:51,465
is less than if you're a male.

1406
01:12:51,465 --> 01:12:56,290


1407
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:57,680
OK?

1408
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:04,220
Now Berkeley is saying
it's sort of the reverse.

1409
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:07,740
The probability
that you're admitted

1410
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:13,260
given that you're a female
in either department

1411
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:17,530
is bigger than the probability
of being admitted if you're

1412
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:19,625
a male in either department.

1413
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:24,720


1414
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:25,220
OK.

1415
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:28,180
So we've now expressed
their arguments

1416
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:33,310
as conditional
probabilities Any questions?

1417
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:37,045
Can you sort of see why
this seems contradictory?

1418
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:39,610


1419
01:13:39,610 --> 01:13:41,800
Not plus, union.

1420
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:45,990
Because this is sort of
like-- these are just joined.

1421
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:50,220
This is the sum of those.

1422
01:13:50,220 --> 01:13:54,680
And this is sort of
the sum of those.

1423
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:58,900
And yet the inequality changed.

1424
01:13:58,900 --> 01:13:59,400
All right.

1425
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:03,150
In fact, this is the logic
that we've just debunked over

1426
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:06,306
there-- exactly that claim.

1427
01:14:06,306 --> 01:14:09,610
In fact, these are
not equal as the sum.

1428
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:13,230


1429
01:14:13,230 --> 01:14:14,270
So let's do an example.

1430
01:14:14,270 --> 01:14:18,370


1431
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:23,107
Say that-- let's
do it over here.

1432
01:14:23,107 --> 01:14:24,690
I'll put the real
values in over here.

1433
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:28,170
Say that for women in
computer science, 0 out of 1

1434
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:32,040
were admitted compared to
the men, were 50 out of 100

1435
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,800
were admitted.

1436
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,680
And then in EE, 70
out of 100 women

1437
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:43,850
were admitted compared to the
men, which had 1 out of 1.

1438
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:44,350
All right?

1439
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:47,450
So as ratios, 70%
is less than 100%.

1440
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:49,620
0% is less than 50.

1441
01:14:49,620 --> 01:14:51,620
Now if I look at the two
departments is a whole,

1442
01:14:51,620 --> 01:15:00,830
I get 70 over 101 is in fact
bigger than 51 over 101.

1443
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:01,330
All right?

1444
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,790
And so as a whole
women are a lot more

1445
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,590
likely to be admitted even
though in each department

1446
01:15:04,590 --> 01:15:06,048
they're less likely
to be admitted.

1447
01:15:06,048 --> 01:15:08,020


1448
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:10,800
OK?

1449
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,700
So what went wrong with
the intuition, which

1450
01:15:13,700 --> 01:15:16,170
you didn't fall victim
to, but people often

1451
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:21,280
do, that it shouldn't have
been possible given that?

1452
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,710
What's going on
here that make it

1453
01:15:22,710 --> 01:15:25,659
so that it's not
a less than when

1454
01:15:25,659 --> 01:15:27,367
you look at the union
of the departments?

1455
01:15:27,367 --> 01:15:33,440


1456
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:34,066
Yeah?

1457
01:15:34,066 --> 01:15:36,190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
they're weighted differently?

1458
01:15:36,190 --> 01:15:36,856
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

1459
01:15:36,856 --> 01:15:39,497
They're weighted
very differently.

1460
01:15:39,497 --> 01:15:41,530
You got huge waves here.

1461
01:15:41,530 --> 01:15:42,030
Right?

1462
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:45,740
So if I look at the average
of the percentages here,

1463
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:50,960
well it's 35% for the women
versus 75% for the men.

1464
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,860
So the average of the percentage
is just what you'd think.

1465
01:15:53,860 --> 01:15:56,280
35 is less than 75.

1466
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:59,910
But I've got huge weightings
on these guys, which changes

1467
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:03,180
the numbers quite dramatically.

1468
01:16:03,180 --> 01:16:04,776
So it all depends
how you count it.

1469
01:16:04,776 --> 01:16:08,432


1470
01:16:08,432 --> 01:16:10,390
Actually, who do you
think had a better-- Yeah.

1471
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:11,226
Go ahead.

1472
01:16:11,226 --> 01:16:12,120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1473
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,411
PROFESSOR: Who won the lawsuit?

1474
01:16:13,411 --> 01:16:15,910
Actually, the woman
won the lawsuit.

1475
01:16:15,910 --> 01:16:18,179
And which argument
would you buy now?

1476
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:19,220
You've got two arguments.

1477
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:23,120
Which one would you
believe if either?

1478
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,250
Which one?

1479
01:16:24,250 --> 01:16:28,820
I mean, now if I look
at exactly this data

1480
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:32,160
I might side-- I might
side with Berkeley

1481
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,400
looking at these numbers.

1482
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,190
Then again, when you think about
all 22 departments and the fact

1483
01:16:38,190 --> 01:16:40,940
they weren't this
lopsided, not so good.

1484
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:43,407
So in the end Berkeley lost.

1485
01:16:43,407 --> 01:16:45,240
I'm going to see another
example in a minute

1486
01:16:45,240 --> 01:16:47,406
where it's even more clear
which side to believe in.

1487
01:16:47,406 --> 01:16:49,330
But it really depends
on the numbers

1488
01:16:49,330 --> 01:16:51,460
as to which one you
might, if you had to vote,

1489
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:54,070
which way you'd vote.

1490
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:56,390
Here's another example.

1491
01:16:56,390 --> 01:17:00,820
This is from a newspaper article
on which airlines are best

1492
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:05,764
to fly because they have
the best on-time rates.

1493
01:17:05,764 --> 01:17:10,300
And in this case they were
comparing American Airlines

1494
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:14,850
and America West,
looking at on-time rates.

1495
01:17:14,850 --> 01:17:18,550
And here's the data they
showed for the two airlines.

1496
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,520
Here's American Airlines.

1497
01:17:20,520 --> 01:17:23,510
Here's America West.

1498
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:31,070
And they took five cities,
LA, Phoenix, San Diego,

1499
01:17:31,070 --> 01:17:33,105
San Francisco, and Seattle.

1500
01:17:33,105 --> 01:17:36,510


1501
01:17:36,510 --> 01:17:41,350
And then you looked
at the number on time,

1502
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:47,349
the number of flights, and then
the rate, percentage on time.

1503
01:17:47,349 --> 01:17:48,390
And then same thing here.

1504
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:57,300
Number on time, number
of flights, and the rate.

1505
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:59,800
So I'm just going to give
you the numbers here.

1506
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:14,100
So they had 500 out of 560 for
a rate of 89%, 220 over 230

1507
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:31,570
for 95, 210 over 230 for
92%, 500 over 600 for 83%,

1508
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:32,430
and then Seattle.

1509
01:18:32,430 --> 01:18:33,580
They had a lot of flights.

1510
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:40,970
That's where they're-- we
have a hub of 2,200 for 86%.

1511
01:18:40,970 --> 01:18:48,520
And if you added them all up,
they got 3,300 out of 3,820

1512
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:54,260
for 87% on time.

1513
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,260
Now the data for
American West looks

1514
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:58,150
something like the following.

1515
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:02,716
In LA it's 700 out
of 800 for 87%.

1516
01:19:02,716 --> 01:19:06,170


1517
01:19:06,170 --> 01:19:07,470
they're based in Phoenix.

1518
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:08,860
They got a zillion
flights there.

1519
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:16,540
4,900 out of 5,300 for 92%.

1520
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:31,860
And 400 over 450 for 89%, 320,
over 450, 71%, 200 over 260

1521
01:19:31,860 --> 01:19:34,290
for 77%.

1522
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:35,730
And then you add all them up.

1523
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:45,110
And you've got 6,520
over 7,260 for 90%.

1524
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:48,530
So the newspaper concluded
and literally said

1525
01:19:48,530 --> 01:19:50,510
that American West
is the better airline

1526
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:53,410
to fly because they're
on-time rate is much better.

1527
01:19:53,410 --> 01:19:55,825
It's 90% versus 87%.

1528
01:19:55,825 --> 01:19:58,880


1529
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:00,420
What do you think?

1530
01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:03,960
Which airline would you
fly looking at that data?

1531
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:04,835
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1532
01:20:04,835 --> 01:20:10,550


1533
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:13,890
PROFESSOR: I know
which one I'd fly.

1534
01:20:13,890 --> 01:20:16,790
It looks like America
West is better.

1535
01:20:16,790 --> 01:20:20,680
Every single city, American
Airlines is better.

1536
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:23,410


1537
01:20:23,410 --> 01:20:25,380
92 versus 89.

1538
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:26,890
Everywhere it's
better by a bunch.

1539
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:29,010
83 versus 71.

1540
01:20:29,010 --> 01:20:31,330
86 versus 77.

1541
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:36,510
Every single city, American
Airlines is better.

1542
01:20:36,510 --> 01:20:40,422
Yet, America West
is better overall.

1543
01:20:40,422 --> 01:20:41,880
And that's what
the newspaper said.

1544
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:43,196
They went on this.

1545
01:20:43,196 --> 01:20:44,987
But of course, no matter
where you're going

1546
01:20:44,987 --> 01:20:46,695
you're better off with
American Airlines.

1547
01:20:46,695 --> 01:20:48,961


1548
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:49,460
All right?

1549
01:20:49,460 --> 01:20:53,880
Now what happened here?

1550
01:20:53,880 --> 01:20:55,270
The waiting.

1551
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:59,460
In fact, America West
flies out of Phoenix

1552
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:02,520
where the weather's great.

1553
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:05,740
So you get a higher on-time rate
when in a good-weather city.

1554
01:21:05,740 --> 01:21:07,690
And they got most of
their flights there.

1555
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:09,940
American Airlines got a
lot of flights in Seattle

1556
01:21:09,940 --> 01:21:14,390
where the weather sucks
and you're always delayed.

1557
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:14,890
All right?

1558
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:16,530
And so they look
worse on average

1559
01:21:16,530 --> 01:21:19,065
because so many of their
flights are in a bad city

1560
01:21:19,065 --> 01:21:22,750
and so many of America
West are in a good city.

1561
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:23,250
All right?

1562
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:24,950
So it makes America
West look better

1563
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:28,420
when in fact, in this case, it's
absolutely clear whose better.

1564
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:31,422
American Airlines is
better, every single city.

1565
01:21:31,422 --> 01:21:32,030
All right.

1566
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:34,860
That's why Mark
Twain said, "There's

1567
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:39,700
three kinds of lies-- lies,
damned lies, and statistics."

1568
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:42,410
We'll see more
examples next time.

1569
01:21:42,410 --> 01:21:45,841
